/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_04.wav,189798,after complex food has been broken down into smaller components it needs to be
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_05.wav,197320,absorbed into the blood and lymph so that it can be transported throughout the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_06.wav,327724,although absorption takes place in different parts of the alimentary canal such as the mouth stomach small intestine and large intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_08.wav,203172,the villi on the intestinal wall increase the surface area of the small intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_09.wav,309334,and help to efficiently absorb the digested nutrients such as such as glucose fructose amino acids and electrolytes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_10.wav,289272,these nutrients from the food pass through the intestinal mucosa into the bloodstream and are distributed throughout the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_11.wav,245804,absorption takes place in the intestinal mucosa through passive transport and active transport
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_13.wav,337756,there are three types of passive transport simple diffusion facilitated transport and osmosis that assist in absorption
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_14.wav,381222,small amounts of glucose amino acids and electrolytes such as chloride ions are generally absorbed from a higher to a lower medium by simple diffusion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_15.wav,331904,whereas fructose and some amino acids are absorbed down a concentration gradient with the help of a specific carrier protein through facilitated diffusion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_16.wav,252492,on the other hand transport of water takes place from a dilute to a concentrated medium through osmosis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_17.wav,185618,absorption also takes place from a lower to a higher medium through active transport
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_19.wav,281748,nutrients such as sodium ions glucose galactose and amino acids are transported actively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_20.wav,201500,unlike carbohydrates and proteins fats are not absorbed through the intestinal villi
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_21.wav,276732,fatty acids and glycerol are insoluble in water and therefore cannot be absorbed by the intestinal cells directly
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_22.wav,243296,they are first acted upon by bile salts to form small spherical droplets called micelles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_24.wav,340262,as micelles enter the intestinal mucosa they are coated with protein to form small fat globules called the chylomicrons
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_25.wav,396270,which are transported into the lymph vessels called lacteals in the villi these lymph vessels ultimately release the absorbed substances into the bloodstream
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_26.wav,239952,besides the small intestine other parts of the digestive system also play a role in the absorption process
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_27.wav,270882,for example certain drugs are placed in the mouth under the tongue so that they can be absorbed directly into the blood capillaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_28.wav,299302,the stomach wall directly absorbs certain foods including simple sugars and alcohol and they do not remain in the stomach
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_29.wav,275898,while water some minerals such as potassium and sodium and drugs are absorbed in the large intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_30.wav,301810,these absorbed nutrients are transported to different tissues of the body through the blood vessels and this process is called assimilation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_31.wav,321872,however the digestive wastes pass through the large intestine where water is absorbed and waste is solidified into faeces
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_32.wav,341934,the faecal matter moves towards the rectum due to peristaltic waves in the walls of the colon which finally eliminates the waste through the anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_33.wav,234938,if the digestive system does not function as smoothly as it should it results in different types of disorders
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_34.wav,199828,inflammation of the intestinal tract takes place when there are bacterial or viral infections
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_36.wav,362832,tape worms round worms thread worms hook worms pin worms and others that usually infect the intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_37.wav,310170,indigestion takes place when food is not properly digested and one experiences a feeling of fullness pain or heartburn
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_38.wav,338590,this usually takes place due to inadequate enzyme secretion anxiety food poisoning overeating and spicy food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_39.wav,278404,constipation is another condition of the digestive system in which an individual has uncomfortable or infrequent bowel movements
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_40.wav,337756,vomiting causes forceful contraction of the stomach and ejection of the stomach contents through the mouth this is preceded by a feeling of nausea
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_41.wav,270046,medical conditions such as jaundice result from excess of bilirubin or bile pigments in the tissues and body fluids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_42.wav,178094,it affects the liver and causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_43.wav,242460,diarrhoea is another condition in which there is an increase in the liquidity of faecal discharge and bowel movements
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_44.wav,246640,it occurs when enough water is not removed from the stool making the stool loose and poorly formed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/absorption_45.wav,345278,thus we have seen that absorption and assimilation of food is essential and disorders in the digestive process can lead to severe complications
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_10.wav,290316,however they dissolve in non polar organic solvents like ethers carbon tetrachloride and benzene
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_11.wav,276940,the melting point boiling point and density of alkynes are directly proportional to their molecular masses
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_12.wav,290316,coming to their chemical properties alkynes exhibit more acidic behaviour than alkenes and alkanes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_13.wav,361368,for example sodium metal and sodamide react with ethyne forming sodium acetylide
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_14.wav,230966,sodium metal and sodamide are strong bases and do not react with alkanes or alkenes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_15.wav,206724,this shows that alkynes are more acidic in nature than alkanes and alkenes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_17.wav,198364,the hydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to the sp hybridised carbon atoms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_18.wav,410688,on the other hand the hydrogen atoms in ethene and ethane are attached to the sp2 and sp3 hybridised carbon atoms respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_19.wav,387282,the sp hybridised orbitals of carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have fifty percentage of s character and hence the highest electro negativity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_20.wav,560318,these electronegative orbitals attract the shared electron pair of the carbon hydrogen bond towards the carbon of ethyne to a greater extent than the sp2 and sp3 hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene and ethane
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_21.wav,220098,therefore the hydrogen atoms in ethyne can be liberated easily as protons
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_22.wav,272762,this makes the hydrogen atoms of ethyne which are attached to the triply bonded carbon atom acidic in nature
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_2.wav,172452,in this module you will learn about the acidic character of alkynes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_3.wav,292824,alkynes follow the same physical characteristics of their predecessors alkanes and alkenes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_5.wav,289480,the alkynes from the fourth to the eleventh in the series are liquids while the higher ones in the series are solids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_6.wav,230966,all alkynes are colourless and odourless except ethyne which has a characteristic smell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_7.wav,226786,alkynes exhibit some polarity unlike alkanes and alkenes which are non polar
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_8.wav,246012,this is because the c h bond in alkynes is slightly polar due to the sp hybridisation of carbon
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acidic_alkynes_9.wav,239324,as alkynes are non polar and water is polar alkynes are water insoluble
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_10.wav,348622,on the other hand oxides of sulphur and nitrogen can also react with metals to form metal sulphates and metal nitrates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_11.wav,339426,further these metal sulphates and metal nitrates combine with water to form sulphuric and nitric acids respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_12.wav,349458,these chemicals come down to earth as acid rain in two forms namely wet deposition and dry deposition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_13.wav,434722,wet deposition is the acidic water that is formed when the acids combine with water they can be in the form of rain snow dew or fog
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_14.wav,204008,we can determine the acidity of rain by considering its ph value
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_15.wav,336920,interestingly unpolluted rain water is also found to be slightly acidic having a ph of about 5 to 6
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_16.wav,359488,the unpolluted rain water is acidic because of the carbon dioxide in the air which combines with water and forms a weak acid
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_17.wav,525000,this slightly acidic rain water turns into acid rain when it combines with gaseous pollutants and forms highly concentrated acids the ph of this rain water decreases to 4
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_18.wav,638686,as far as dry deposition is concerned it takes place through acidic wind that is formed by the combination of acidic gases like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and acidic particles like metal nitrates and metal sulphates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_19.wav,229086,dry deposits get accumulated on the surfaces of tall trees and large buildings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_20.wav,281748,during rain these dry deposits combine with water and get washed down as acid rain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_21.wav,260850,let us now see how acid rain has an effect on almost all the aspects of the environment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_22.wav,528344,acid rain is harmful to human beings animals plants microorganisms aquatic beings soil water resources monuments metals etc
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_23.wav,279240,for instance long term exposure to acid rain drenches plants and may burn them completely
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_24.wav,297630,exposure to acid rain for a while affects the enzymatic activity in plants and leads to their wilting
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_25.wav,184782,acid rain also leads to increased mortality of seedlings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_26.wav,428034,apart from plants humans who get directly exposed to high concentration of acid rain get burns on their skin in animals it can even cause death
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_27.wav,367848,acid rain with low concentration of acids causes severe irritation of skin and burning sensation of eyes in both animals and humans
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_28.wav,200664,let us now see how acid rain affects soil microorganisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_29.wav,391254,acid rain reduces the respiratory rate of soil microorganisms like bacteria thereby slowing down the decomposition process in the forest floor
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_2.wav,166392,in this module you will learn about acid rain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_30.wav,563452,further acid rain also makes the fungi vulnerable to diseasecausing pathogens by damaging their protective layer called cuticle and other features which in turn affects the forest floors decomposition process
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_31.wav,315186,in addition it also causes a decline in the number of nitrogenfixing algae in the soil which further affects plant growth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_32.wav,417168,as far as aquatic animals are concerned acid rain is poisonous to them since it directly dumps acids into water resources making them more acidic
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_33.wav,354474,aquatic organisms such as zooplanktons and smaller invertebrates such as snails also face destruction due to acid rain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_34.wav,276732,let us now look at how acid rain affects the soil acid rain makes the soil acidic
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_35.wav,264194,this gradually reduces its fertility thus affecting crops and forests growing in it
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_36.wav,391254,acid rain also causes the release of toxic chemicals such as aluminium and mercury into the soil making it unfit for the survival of plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_37.wav,170572,potable water resources become poisonous due to acid rain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_38.wav,355310,have you ever heard of stone cancer caused by acid rain we are aware of the fact that marble is mainly composed of calcium carbonate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_39.wav,339426,this calcium carbonate reacts with acids in the rain and corrodes the marble thus resulting in stone cancer
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_3.wav,258342,look at the two images of taj mahal do you know what is responsible for the corrosion of this wonder of the world
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_40.wav,317692,stone cancer damages the marblemade historic monuments to a great extent and leads to their discolouration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_41.wav,324380,likewise metal objects that get exposed to acid rain undergo corrosion and also lose their lustre
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_42.wav,429706,acid rain can be controlled by reducing the accumulation of gaseous pollutants like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen released from factories and automobiles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_4.wav,177258,it is acid rain so what is acid rain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_5.wav,528344,acid rain refers to the deposition of acidic components from the atmosphere on to the earth in the form of rain snow dew fog gases or atmospheric particles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_6.wav,198156,let us now see where the acid rain picks up the acidic components from
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_7.wav,591038,industries power stations and vehicles generate oxides of sulphur such as sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide and oxides of nitrogen such as nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_8.wav,265866,these gases linger in the atmosphere as gaseous pollutants and cause air pollution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/acid_rain_9.wav,395434,moreover the highly reactive oxides of sulphur and nitrogen combine with water droplets to form sulphuric and nitric acids respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_10.wav,280912,the body of this rodent is also capable of concentrating its urine so that very little water is used to remove waste products
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_11.wav,438902,likewise the camel can also survive without water for 10 days at a stretch and is capable of raising its body temperature to nearly 42 c to prevent the loss of water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_12.wav,405464,similarly many desert plants have a thick layer of cuticle on their leaves with their stomata embedded in deep pits to reduce the loss of water through transpiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_13.wav,466486,these plants have also adopted a special photosynthetic pathway called cam or crassulacean acid metabolism which enables their stomata to remain closed during the day
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_14.wav,366176,some desert plants like the opuntia have leaves that are reduced to spines and its flattened spongy stems perform photosynthesis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_15.wav,442244,while some plants and animals have adapted to prevent the loss of water some animals particularly those found in colder regions have adapted themselves to prevent the loss of heat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_16.wav,479026,for instance mammals from colder climates generally have shorter tails limbs and ears which help reduce loss of heat this adaptation is called allens rule
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_17.wav,559274,moreover in the polar seas aquatic mammals such as seals whales and dolphins have a thick layer of fat known as blubber below their skin which acts as an insulator and minimises the loss of body heat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_18.wav,296796,apart from morphological adaptations some organisms physiologically adapt themselves to respond to stressful situations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_19.wav,234938,for example as you ascend a mountain atmospheric pressure and oxygen decrease
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_20.wav,314350,and you begin to experience altitude sickness its symptoms are fatigue nausea and palpitations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_21.wav,353638,but in two to three days your body gets acclimatised to such stressful conditions after which you dont experience altitude sickness
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_22.wav,455620,this is because your body has increased the production of red blood cells decreased the binding capacity of haemoglobin and increased your rate of breathing to compensate for low levels of atmospheric oxygen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_23.wav,262522,this also explains why tribes living in high altitudes have higher haemoglobin than those dwelling in the plains
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_24.wav,760730,while some organisms adapt themselves to live in high altitudes a variety of marine invertebrates such as jellyfish octopus starfish and fish such as the angler fish and lantern fish thrive in deep ocean waters where the pressure could be 100 times more than the normal atmospheric pressure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_25.wav,265866,such organisms show a fascinating array of biochemical adaptations to survive in such extreme conditions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_26.wav,637014,another interesting adaptation is by organisms found in harsh habitats such as deep sea hydrothermal vents and hot springs where temperatures exceed 100 c here microbes belonging to archaebacteria form flourish
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_27.wav,443916,while some organisms thrive in temperatures above 100 c other organisms flourish in the arctic and antarctic waters where temperatures are always below zero
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_28.wav,341934,apart from physiological and morphological adaptations some organisms also show behavioural adaptations to cope with their changing environment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_29.wav,436394,for example the desert lizard manages to keep its body temperature fairly constant by absorbing heat lying in the sun when its body temperature is below normal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_2.wav,181438,in this module you will learn about adaptations by organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_30.wav,170572,but when the ambient temperature is high it moves into the shade
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_31.wav,607756,likewise some organisms such as earthworms frogs moles and snakes burrow into the soil to escape the above ground heat therefore these animals are rarely seen on the ground in scorching summers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_32.wav,370356,in this way to adapt to unfavourable conditions organisms have undergone morphological physiological and behavioural changes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_3.wav,244968,some animals live in arid regions while some animals thrive in polar regions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_4.wav,549242,plants in the tropical rainforests have drip tips and thick waxy surfaces that allow water to run off while desert plants have spongy stems which store water and leaves reduced to tiny pointed spines
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_5.wav,366176,on our planet every organism adapts to stressful environmental conditions through morphological physiological and behavioural means
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_6.wav,780792,in fact the responses of these organisms are their adaptations to cope in unfavourable or stressful conditions in other words adaptation is any attribute of the organism that enables it to survive and reproduce in its habitat lets look at some of the morphological adaptations exhibited by organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_7.wav,230758,over the course of evolution many adaptations have evolved and have been genetically fixed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_8.wav,325216,although life originated in water and is unable to sustain without it some organisms can survive without water for days
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adaptation_9.wav,489892,in the case of the kangaroo rat in the north american deserts the animal meets its water requirements by metabolic water metabolic water is released as a by product during oxidation of fat in its body

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_11.wav,655608,addition in unsymmetrical alkynes takes place in accordance with markovnikovs rule this rule says that in an electrophilic addition reaction the negative part of an addendum attaches itself to the unsaturated carbon atom of the molecule having least number of hydrogen atoms for example propyne reacts with two molecules of hydrogen bromide and forms 2 2 dibromo propane in accordance with markovnikoffs rule as shown here
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_12.wav,248516,like alkanes and alkenes alkynes are also immiscible and do not react with water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_13.wav,443284,however in the presence of dilute sulphuric acid and mercuric sulphate at sixty degrees celsius alkynes add one water molecule to give aldehydes or ketones
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_14.wav,567836,for example ethyne reacts with a water molecule in the presence of dilute sulphuric acid and mercuric sulphate at sixty degrees celsius to give ethanal similarly propyne reacts to give propanone
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_15.wav,455824,polymerisation is of two types linear polymerisation and cyclic polymerisation when heated in the presence of a catalyst alkynes undergo polymerisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_16.wav,199196,in linear polymerisation the alkyne molecules form a long chain polymer
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_17.wav,275266,for example linear polymerisation of ethyne produces polyacetylene or polyethyne
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_18.wav,536072,polyethyne is a high molecular weight polyene which consists of repeating units as shown here the polyethyne molecule is represented as shown it conducts electricity under special conditions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_19.wav,199196,that is why a thin film of polyethyne is used as an electrode in batteries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_20.wav,287804,in cyclic polymerisation alkyne molecules add to each other resulting in the formation of a cyclic compound
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_21.wav,368888,for example when ethyne is passed through a red hot iron tube at eight hundred seventy three kelvin it undergoes cyclic polymerisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_22.wav,222602,in this cyclic polymerisation three molecules of ethyne polymerise to form benzene
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_23.wav,211736,because of their polymerisation abilities alkynes combine to form many different compounds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_24.wav,426566,for example benzene obtained by the polymerisation of acetylene is used for the preparation of dyes drugs and a large number of other organic compounds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_2.wav,169940,in this module you will learn about the addition reactions of alkynes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_3.wav,737528,the addition reactions in alkynes are electrophilic in nature due to the availability of loosely held pi electrons as alkynes contain a triple bond during an addition reaction they add two molecules of dihydrogen halogen or hydrogen halides to form a saturated molecule
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_4.wav,855392,vinylic cation is formed as an intermediate during the addition reaction of an alkyne whereas alkyl carbocation is formed as an intermediate during the addition reaction of an alkene as vinylic cation is less stable than alkyl carbocation alkynes are less reactive towards the addition reactions than alkenes hence the addition reactions of alkynes take place under drastic conditions when compared to the addition reactions of alkenes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_6.wav,751738,an alkyne reacts with two molecules of dihydrogen in the presence of suitable catalysts like finely divided nickel platinum or palladium to form the corresponding alkane for example propyne reacts with two molecules of dihydrogen in the presence of finely divided nickel as catalyst to form propane
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_7.wav,383934,alkynes form dihaloalkene when treated with one molecule of halogen and form tetrahaloalkane when treated with two molecules of halogen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_8.wav,585390,for example when ethyne reacts with one molecule of bromine it forms 1 2 dibromo ethene and when it reacts two molecules of bromine 1 1 2 2 tetrabromoethane is formed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/addn_alkynes_9.wav,460840,the reddish brown colour of bromine decolorises due to the formation of saturated 1 1 2 2 tetrabromoethane thus this reaction is used as a test for unsaturation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_10.wav,487384,or peer pressure often some youngsters are seen advocating drugs drinks and alcohol as cool thereby increasing the number of youngsters that are lured to these vices
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_11.wav,573484,television movies newspapers and the internet add to these perceptions by flashing cool images of smoking and drinking in popular public figures such as actors singers and sportspersons
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_12.wav,646208,led by all these factors adolescents frequently begin to use drugs alcohol and smoke repeatedly the temporary feeling of euphoria and calmness that drugs and drinks provide drives youngsters to seek these out even when not needed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_13.wav,435558,and even though this consumption proves self destructive this psychological attachment to the effects of drug and alcohol that leave a temporary feeling of well being is called addiction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_14.wav,703052,the inherent addictive nature of both alcohol and drugs ensures that with repeated use the tolerance level of receptors present in the body increases as a result these receptors respond only to higher doses of drugs and alcohol leading to increased intake and addiction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_15.wav,606920,thus the drug abuser or alcoholic person is drawn into a helpless vicious circle where they consume drugs or alcohol regularly and can t stop without any counselling or support they become dependent on drugs and alcohol
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_16.wav,342770,dependence is defined by the tendency of the body to display unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if their regular dose of drugs or alcohol is discontinued
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_17.wav,581844,deprived of drugs and alcohol the addicted youngster displays symptoms such as anxiety shakiness nausea palpitations and sweating all these symptoms stop when drug/alcohol use is resumed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_19.wav,366176,therefore adequate moral support and counselling at home and in school is required during adolescence to avoid substance abuse among youngsters
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_20.wav,282584,also the addicted youngsters can be helped and rehabilitated with professional medical care along with counselling

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_3.wav,499924,every child during the ages of 12 to 18 undergoes both physical and behavioural changes this period between 12 and 18 years is known as adolescence
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_4.wav,540884,during this period both boys and girls register rapid physical growth accompanied by changes like the growth of body hair and a sexual awakening the voice starts to break to become deeper in the case of boys
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_5.wav,282584,in the wake of all these changes adolescents are very vulnerable mentally and psychologically during this time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_6.wav,478190,adolescence is the crucial period that acts as a bridge between childhood and adulthood when curiosity and the need to experiment and discover themselves is powerful among youngsters
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_8.wav,611100,that takes them to drugs alcohol and smoking though the first time is usually due to curiosity later the youngster is tempted to take drugs drink or smoke on a regular basis due to their perceived stress buster effects
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/adolescence_9.wav,237444,this might serve as a way to escape the stress to perform academically an unsupportive family
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_10.wav,406300,louis blanc however felt that an individual could not build a cooperative community instead he pushed for the governments to encourage cooperatives
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_11.wav,522492,karl marx stated in his book das kapital that workers needed to overthrow capitalism and create a society where property was controlled collectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_12.wav,229922,friedrich engels too contributed to these thoughts through his book the communist manifesto
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_13.wav,294288,though they had minor differences in their ideas they all agreed that socialism was the natural way forward
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_14.wav,385402,as socialist ideas spread across europe the socialists formed the second international to act as a body to coordinate their efforts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_15.wav,264194,it was not until nineteen fourteen that socialists finally managed to form a government in europe
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_2.wav,197320,in this module you will learn about the advent of socialism in europe
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_3.wav,292616,as you have already seen the working conditions of people across europe during the industrial revolution were pitiable
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_4.wav,285092,this coupled with low wages acted as a perfect platform for the advent of socialism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_5.wav,241624,socialists felt that the private ownership of property was the root of all social evil
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_6.wav,328560,although they agreed that property owners provided jobs they also felt that owners were not interested in the welfare of the workers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_7.wav,234938,considering this socialism propagated the idea of collective ownership of property
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_8.wav,350294,some of the eminent socialist thinkers were robert owen louis blanc karl marx and friedrich engels
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/advent_socialism_europe_9.wav,257506,robert owen believed in the idea of cooperatives and tried to build one in indiana
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_10.wav,161376,lets see what exactly changed the landscape of england so drastically
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_11.wav,290108,in the sixteenth century the price of wool shot up this was seen by the rich landlords as an opportunity to make more profits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_12.wav,242460,they wanted to increase their wool production improve their sheep breeds and provide a better feed for them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_13.wav,372028,to do this they needed large enclosed plots of land so they started drawing up hedges around their lands to demarcate their property from those of the others
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_14.wav,299302,they also drove out people who had built small cottages on the common land and prevented anyone from entering their privately enclosed land
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_15.wav,331904,the enclosure movement caught speed in the late eighteenth century and by 1850 six million acres of land was enclosed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_18.wav,319364,the demand for food grains increased to meet the needs of the large number of people who had moved to the urban areas to work in the industries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_19.wav,304318,in addition france went to war with england around the late eighteenth century disrupting the import of food grains from europe
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_1.wav,169736,until the eighteenth century the countryside in england was open
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_20.wav,354474,taking advantage of this higher demand for food the rich landlords started a frenzy of enclosing lands for grain cultivation to make bigger profits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_21.wav,227414,they demanded enclosure acts as the early enclosures were not supported by the government or the church
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_22.wav,254164,eventually after the mid eighteenth century the parliament passed 4000 enclosure acts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_23.wav,338590,the landscape and the agriculture system of england had changed completely bringing fortunes for the richer landlords and misery for the poor peasants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_3.wav,337756,each villager was allocated different strips of land to cultivate this was decided at the beginning of a year in an annual public meeting
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_4.wav,300138,though these strips of land were at different places it ensured that each villager got a balanced mix of both good and bad quality of land
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_5.wav,255000,another unique quality of the english countryside was the common land that lay beyond the agricultural strips of land
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_6.wav,465650,this common land was open to all villagers and was used for a variety of purposes like pastures for their cows grazing their sheep and for collecting fuel wood fruits and berries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_7.wav,277568,however the landscape of england changed suddenly during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_8.wav,248312,poor peasants were no longer allowed to enter the common land and carry out their activities for their livelihood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_england_9.wav,356146,furthermore even the strips of land that they were allotted for cultivation were taken over by the richer landlords and surrounded by private enclosures
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_10.wav,486548,they changed the entire landscape and replaced the natural wilderness with cultivated fields of corn and wheat however it still had not achieved the title of the bread basket of the world
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_11.wav,346114,this remarkable change came only after the 1860s when the white settlers moved into the great plains across the mississippi river
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_12.wav,378716,the great plains went on to become the major wheat producing area in the future earning the usa the title of the bread basket of the world
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_13.wav,289272,the wheat production in the usa boomed to meet the growing needs of the urban population and the export market
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_14.wav,383730,the development of railways further supported this boom as it became easier to transport wheat from the central great plains to the ports on the east coast
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_15.wav,590202,ironically world war one also contributed to the boom as the supply of wheat to europe from russia was cut off the big farmers or the wheat barons as they were called took full advantage of the situation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_16.wav,236608,the wheat production in the usa expanded by 65 percent by nineteen twenty
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_1.wav,248312,did you know that america was also known as the bread basket of the world lets see how this name came about
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_2.wav,284256,towards the end of the eighteenth century a major part of the usa was still covered with natural vegetation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_3.wav,368684,a large portion of the country was inhabited by the native american indians who depended on hunting gathering and fishing for a livelihood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_4.wav,159704,many of them were nomads while a few were settled
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_5.wav,721442,however things changed after the american war of independence that was fought between 1775 and 1783 united states of america was formed and the white settlers were now keen to exploit the many opportunities that the usa presented to them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_6.wav,463142,they were eager to turn the wild natural vegetation into cultivated fields and use timber for export this led to a turning point in the history of agriculture in america
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_7.wav,472338,the government of the usa adopted a policy of driving out native american indians to pave way for the white settlers to spread across the country towards the west
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_8.wav,254164,by the beginning of the eighteenth century the white settlers settled on the appalachian plateau
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/agr_us_9.wav,254164,they moved further into the mississippi valley between 1820 and 1850
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_10.wav,206516,sharing infected needles and from an infected mother to a child through the placenta
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_11.wav,402120,so other than children born to hiv infected mothers people most susceptible to aids are drug abusers who use needles too often to take drug intravenously
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_12.wav,380386,individuals who have multiple sexual partners and patients of diseases such as thalassemia or dialysis who require frequent blood transfusions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_13.wav,182274,it is evident from these examples that aids spreads only through body fluids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_15.wav,416332,therefore it is advisable that hiv/aids infected people are not isolated from their family and society for their physical and psychological well being
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_16.wav,393762,the incubation period of aids that is the time lag between infection and appearance of aids symptoms ranges from a couple of months to many years
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_17.wav,513298,once the hiv virus is inside the body it enters the macrophages where rna the genome of the virus replicates to form viral dna aided by enzyme reverse transcriptase
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_18.wav,567632,the viral dna takes over the host cells dna and directs infected cells to produce virus particles the macrophages produce an army of viruses therefore acting as an hiv factory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_19.wav,468158,at the same time hiv enters helper t lymphocytes and produces progeny viruses which when released into the blood attack other helper t lymphocytes in the body of the infected person
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_20.wav,404628,the process is repeated till the number of helper t lymphocytes gradually decreases inside the body resulting in reduced production of antibodies which affects the immune system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_21.wav,189798,the infected individuals suffer from diarrhoea fever and weight loss
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_22.wav,830946,they become so immune deficient due to the loss of helper t lymphocytes that they are vulnerable to infections caused by bacteria like myobacterium viruses fungi and even parasites like toxoplasma had the hiv virus not infected the body these infections would have been naturally fought by the bodys immune system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_23.wav,266702,the elisa or enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay test is commonly used to diagnose aids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_24.wav,478190,whereas anti retroviral drugs are used to treat aids however drugs can only prolong the life of an aids patient death is inevitable due to the gradual loss of immunity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_25.wav,491564,since aids has no cure prevention is the key to keep it at bay it is important to ensure that blood banks have safe blood and only disposable needles and syringes are used
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_27.wav,206516,sex education must be imparted to the masses so that people indulge only in safe sex
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_28.wav,243296,and condoms should be freely distributed and regular check ups made a must among susceptible populations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_29.wav,176422,the who has started several initiatives to check the spread of aids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_30.wav,840142,in india as well some ngos and organisations like naco that is the national aids control organisation work to create awareness about aids so that the disease does not spread due to ignorance these organisations encourage that hiv infection is not hidden or it may further spread
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_31.wav,535032,moreover awareness is also important so that society doesnt shun aids patients together with the medical fraternity and treatment society plays an important role in the mental well being of an aids patient
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_32.wav,475682,therefore though aids is caused due to acquired deficiency in immunity due to ignorance and unsafe lifestyle practices aids patients need our help and sympathy rather than our disapproval
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/aids_3.wav,344442,since 1981 when aids was first discovered it has now become a pandemic spreading through human populations around the world

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_50.wav,220922,therefore cutting down trees and burning fossil fuels damages atmospheric balance
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_51.wav,352162,an increase in carbon dioxide leads to an increase in the average global temperature this is known as global warming lets understand how
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_52.wav,210892,our earth is covered with a multi layered ball of air called the atmosphere
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_53.wav,398138,when the suns ray come towards the earth one layer absorbs the harmful rays like ultra violet rays and lets the rest pass to reach the earths surface
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_54.wav,246000,near the earths surface another layer traps the suns heat so that the earth is perfect for life
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_55.wav,235968,in response the earths hot surface also sends back some infrared light a part of which is
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_57.wav,211728,this process is very much similar to a greenhouse where the glass holds the suns heat inside
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_58.wav,554454,therefore gases in the atmosphere that trap the suns heat are known as greenhouse gases water vapour carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane are some of the major greenhouse gases
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_59.wav,340458,when the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases they trap more heat from the sun and also from the earths surface

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_6.wav,218414,pollution is the harmful effect on the environment that can prove fatal to all living organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_7.wav,316218,it is caused by the contamination of the air water and soil by harmful substances known as pollutants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_8.wav,305350,pollutants can be solid liquid or gas and originate from human actions and natural sources
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/air_sana_9.wav,632194,harmful waste products discarded by humans degenerate in nature when this rate of degradation is slow its potential of harm increases sometimes the rate of natural degradation is so slow that the pollutant can cause harm for years and years
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_10.wav,356982,while asexual reproduction takes place through spores like zoospores these spores are flagellated and germinate into new plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_11.wav,204844,during sexual reproduction two gametes fuse to form a new organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_12.wav,435558,based on the size of the gametes sexual reproduction can be further divided into isogamous anisogamous and oogamous reproduction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_13.wav,227414,when the fusion is between two gametes of similar size the reproduction is called isogamous
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_14.wav,168064,the gametes in this case can be flagellated as in chlamydomonas
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_16.wav,258342,when fusion takes place between two gametes of dissimilar size the reproduction is termed as anisogamous
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_17.wav,310170,oogamus is a fusion between a large non motile female gamete and a small motile male gamete
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_19.wav,326888,they carry out carbon dioxide fixation and also increase the level of dissolved oxygen in their immediate surroundings through photosynthesis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_20.wav,173916,they produce energy rich compounds that form food for aquatic organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_21.wav,502430,algae are also used for commercial purposes for instance agar obtained from gelidium and gracilari is used to prepare ice creams and jellies
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_23.wav,242460,we can classify algae into chlorophyceae phaeophyceae and rhodophyceae
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_24.wav,252492,chlamydomonas volvox and spirogyra are some members of the class chlorophyceae
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_26.wav,183110,and can have a unicellular colonial or filamentous body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_27.wav,244132,their cell wall is rigid as the outer layer is made of pectose and the inner layer of cellulose
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_28.wav,257506,the cell has several chloroplasts that contain pyrenoids structures that have starch and protein
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_29.wav,350294,in definite chloroplasts you can find localised pigments chlorophyll a and b that give the algae the colour of green grass
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_30.wav,346114,green algae can reproduce vegetatively through fragmentation and asexually by flagellated zoospores as well as sexually
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_32.wav,204008,ectocarpus dictyota laminaria are some of its members
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_33.wav,268374,these species commonly termed as brown algae are mostly found in brackish or salt water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_36.wav,200664,whereas kelps are profusely branched and can measure 100 metres in height
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_37.wav,305990,they also vary in colour due to the varying concentration of the pigments xanthophylls and fucoxanthin
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_38.wav,325216,apart from these pigments chlorophyll a c and carotenoids are the other major pigments found in brown algae
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_39.wav,197320,lets now take a look at the body structure and cellular structure of brown algae
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_3.wav,174750,you must have often seen a slimy green layer on rocks lying close to the sea
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_40.wav,451440,the plant body consists of a frond a leaf like photosynthetic organ and a stipe that functions as a stalk the frond and stipe are attached to the substratum by a holdfast
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_41.wav,586858,the vegetative cells of brown algae have a cellulosic wall which usually has an outer gelatinous coating of algin the protoplast inside the cell has plastids and a centrally located vacuole and nucleus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_42.wav,588530,brown algae produce through fragmentation and asexually through biflagellate spores on the other hand in sexual reproduction the gametes unite either in water or within the oogonium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_44.wav,260014,polysiphonia gracilaria and gelidium the members are often called red algae
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_45.wav,550078,the red colour is due to a high concentration of the red pigment r phycoerythrin the thalli of red algae are multicellular and food is stored as floridean starch inside the cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_46.wav,221562,red algae are found in brackish and salt water and mostly in warmer areas
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_47.wav,288436,red algae reproduce vegetatively asexually through non motile spores and sexually through motile spores
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_48.wav,176422,thus we have seen that there are a variety of algae that thrive in the aquatic habitat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_4.wav,330232,this green layer is algae these are simple thalloid chlorophyll bearing autotrophic organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_5.wav,287600,you can spot algae growing on moist rocks and stones in marine and fresh water and wood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_7.wav,581008,for instance chlamydomonas is unicellular whereas volvox is of colonial form and spirogyra is filamentous on the other hand kelps form massive plant bodies
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_8.wav,193978,algae reproduce through vegetative asexual and sexual methods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/algae_9.wav,275062,vegetative reproduction occurs by the process of fragmentation wherein each fragment develops into a thallus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_10.wav,614640,the alkali metals are all shiny and silvery in appearance they are so soft that they can be cut with a table knife which is often surprising to students like all metals they are good conductors of both heat and electricity as shown in the diagram they will form a dull oxide layer on their outer surface when exposed to air this layer can easily be cut away to reveal the shiny interior
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_11.wav,240984,recall that the alkali metals all have electron configurations ending as s one
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_12.wav,682350,the single valence electron for each of these elements is relatively loosely attracted to the nucleus if this sole valence electron is lost then the resulting ion is isoelectronic  that is having the same number of electrons as the preceding noble gas
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_13.wav,259374,thus the typical ion formed by an alkali metal is a cation with a charge of plus one
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_14.wav,786004,lets go on and review some periodic properties as they relate to the alkali metals as you consider the group one elements from top to bottom atomic radius increases this can be explained because as you move down the group there is increase in the number of shells and therefore the atomic radii increases
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_15.wav,940648,the cations that form are in all cases smaller than the neutral parent ion since there are fewer electrons there are fewer electron electron repulsions and so the radius is smaller for the cation for essentially the same reasons as we discussed with atomic radius the cation radii for the group one metals increase from the top to the bottom of the group
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_16.wav,384762,as shown in the graphic moving from left to right across a period the alkali metals have the largest atomic radius of any element in the period
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_17.wav,375568,try to answer this question on your own before you proceed where in the periodic table would you expect to find elements with the largest atomic radii
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_18.wav,286960,the largest atoms are found in the lower left hand corner of the periodic table cesium and francium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_19.wav,683186,recall that ionisation energy is defined as the energy required to remove the outermost electron from an isolated gas phase atom since the valence electrons are significantly shielded from the nuclear charge the ionisation energies of the alkali metals are relatively low
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_1.wav,538568,in this module you will learn to describe the chemical and physical properties of the alkali metals which are found in the s block of the periodic table you will also learn the general characteristics of compounds containing alkali metals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_20.wav,332936,in general ionisation energies decrease down a column and the alkali metals are no exception as shown in the graph
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_21.wav,877118,enthalpy of formation or hydration energy is the amount of energy released when one mole of an ion is dissolved in a large amount of water in general as the ionic radii get larger hydration energy decreases and so the enthalpy of hydration decreases from lithium to cesium one result is that lithium salts unlike the salts of the other alkali metals often form hydrates such as lithium chloride dihydrate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_22.wav,631358,how can we test for the presence of alkali metals in a particular sample one simple and qualitative test is the flame test if a small amount of a metal salt is held in a flame characteristic colour changes can be observed due to the movement of electrons electrons get excited to higher energy levels from the heat of the flame and emit energy as light as they return to their ground state for a quantitative test atomic absorption spectrometry can be used based on the same fundamental principles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_23.wav,792690,lets look at the result of some flame tests lithium gives a cheerful candy apple red colour this yellow colour is characteristic of sodium you may have observed it if a boiling salt water sample spills over when cooking on a gas stove potassium flame tests emit a lilac coloured flame
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_24.wav,811916,lets apply our knowledge to a problem an explosion occurred in a chemical storage tank at acme chemical company an employee while filing a claim for workers compensation for injuries states that the potassium nitrate being stored in the tank must have been responsible for the green flames he observed is the employee being truthful
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_25.wav,357178,we just learned that the presence of potassium gives a lilac flame therefore we must conclude that the employee is not being truthful
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_26.wav,478386,lets discuss some chemical properties of the alkali metals starting with their reactions with oxygen they all react vigorously with oxygen they dont all form the same kinds of oxides though
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_27.wav,619656,lithium reacts with oxygen to form a simple oxide li two o sodium forms sodium peroxide na two o two the other metals all form superoxides for example cs o two
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_28.wav,737520,the oxides and peroxides that form from the alkali metals are typically white solids as shown in the illustrations they are basic anhydrides when placed in water they will generate hydroxide ions and thus basic solutions as shown in this reaction for lithium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_29.wav,307022,the alkali metal superoxides which only form with the larger alkali metals are typically yellow or orange in colour
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_2.wav,274420,where is the s block in the periodic table its the first two columns or groups of the periodic table
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_30.wav,457488,lets try some problem solving what is the oxidation number of each element in the compounds lithium oxide sodium peroxide and rubidium superoxide
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_31.wav,608788,recall that the sum of the oxidation numbers must be zero for a neutral compound for lithium oxide since each lithium ion must have an oxidation number of plus one the oxygen ion must have a charge of minus two using similar logic since each sodium ion has an oxidation number of plus one each oxygen in the peroxide ion must have an oxidation number of minus one rubidium here has an oxidation number of plus one so each oxygen in the superoxide ion must have an oxidation number of minus one half
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_32.wav,612968,as was mentioned earlier in this module the alkali metals all react with water these reactions release hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas as shown in the equation here the reactions become increasingly more explosive down the column
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_33.wav,366372,the alkali metals all react with hydrogen these reactions produce metal hydrides which are ionic solids with high melting points
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_34.wav,558634,the alkali metals react very vigorously with the halogens one classic example shown in the photo is the formation of table salt or sodium chloride from sodium metal and chlorine gas
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_35.wav,661452,the alkali metal halides are crystalline solids as shown in the photograph they have characteristically high melting points and are soluble in water these are very stable compounds as evidenced by their large negative enthalpies of formation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_36.wav,820276,since the alkali metals have a high tendency to lose their valence electrons they oxidise readily when they oxidise they cause some other substance to become reduced and so we can say that alkali metals are good reducing agents remember the substance that is oxidised in a redox reaction is called the reducing agent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/alkali1_37.wav,599594,the alkali metals will dissolve in liquid ammonia as the metals dissolve the resulting solution turns blue as shown in the photograph the blue colour is due to ammoniated electrons which absorb visible light the solutions are paramagnetic which means that they are attracted to an externally applied magnetic field when allowed to stand the solutions slowly release hydrogen gas as amides are formed as shown in the reaction when concentrated these solutions turn a bronze colour and become diamagnetic

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/amphibolic_6.wav,348622,so far we have seen how the glucose substrate is oxidised during glycolysis and observed the krebs cycle during aerobic respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/amphibolic_7.wav,228250,but plants also use substances such as fats and proteins as respiratory substrates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/amphibolic_8.wav,336920,though pure fats or proteins cannot be directly used as substrates they can enter as intermediary substrates of glycolysis and the krebs cycle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/amphibolic_9.wav,186454,now lets see how fats and proteins are utilised as respiratory substrates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_03.wav,647044,you must have come across banana plantations apple orchards or herbs such as basil you may have also seen flowers such as lotus and roses growing in ponds and gardens all these are species of flowering plants also called angiosperms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_07.wav,265866,a typical flower of an angiosperm contains the stamen and the pistil the male and female sex organs respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_09.wav,182274,the microsporangia inside the anther contain the microspore mother cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_10.wav,331068,these mother cells undergo meiosis to produce microspores which then develop into pollen grains the male gametophytes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_12.wav,244968,on the other hand the pistil consists of the stigma at the tip followed by the style in the middle and an ovary at the base
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_13.wav,187290,the ovules or the megasproangia are present inside the ovary
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_15.wav,227414,which following meiosis develops into the haploid female gametophyte called the embryo sac
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_16.wav,407136,the embryo sac has a three celled egg apparatus consisting of one egg cell two synergids three antipodal cells and two polar nuclei
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_17.wav,318528,the polar nuclei eventually fuse to produce a diploid secondary nucleus the embryo sac now becomes ready for fertilisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_18.wav,197320,which in the case of angiosperms takes place by a process called pollination
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_19.wav,402956,during pollination the anther disperses the pollen grains which are then carried by agents such as the wind and insects and are deposited over the stigma of a pistil
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_20.wav,396270,here the pollen grain germinates and produces a pollen tube this tube penetrates the tissues of the stigma and style to enter the embryo sac inside the ovule
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_21.wav,530016,it discharges two male gametes inside the embryo sac while one gamete fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote the other gamete fuses with the diploid secondary nucleus to produce the triploid primary endosperm nucleus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_22.wav,371192,this event is called double fertilisation as it involves two fusions interestingly double fertilisation is observed only in angiosperms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_23.wav,786644,after fertilisation the synergids and antipodals degenerate on the other hand the zygote develops into an embryo and the primary endosperm nucleus develops into endosperm which nourishes the zygote simultaneously the ovule develops into a seed and the ovary into fruit
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_25.wav,336084,angiosperms are one of the biggest plant groups and they grow in diverse habitats such as land and water as well as in different climatic conditions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/angiosperms_26.wav,447260,besides being a source of food they supply us with fuel fodder and medicines thus angiosperms form an integral part of the eco system as well as of our daily lives
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_10.wav,220726,whereas humans have a complete digestive system that has two openings a mouth and an anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_11.wav,214040,you will also find two types of circulatory systems in animals open and closed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_13.wav,621132,they can be asymmetrical like sponges or have radial symmetry like coelenterates ctenophores and echinoderms however most animals like annelids and arthropods have bilateral symmetry
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_15.wav,194812,there are two types of cell organisation diploblastic and triploblastic
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_16.wav,366176,coelenterates have diploblastic organisation where the germinal layers of the cell consist of an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_17.wav,492400,members from phylum platyhelminthes to chordates have triploblastic organisation where a third germinal layer the mesoderm is found between the ectoderm and the endoderm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_18.wav,194812,the fourth important feature by which animals are classified is the nature of coelom
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_19.wav,301810,the coelom is the body cavity lined by mesoderm the presence or absence of this cavity helps classify animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_1.wav,234938,with over a million animal species on our earth it would be difficult to categorise them into different groups
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_20.wav,286764,there are three categories coelomates acoelomates and pseudocoelomates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_21.wav,450604,coelomates are animals that possess a body cavity such as annelids molluscs arthropods echinoderms hemichordates and chordates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_22.wav,244132,acoelomates are animals in which the body cavity is absent such as platyhelminthes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_23.wav,572648,pseudocoelomates are animals that possess a pseudocoelom such as aschelminthes a pseudocoelom is a body cavity in which the mesoderm is not lined but rather scattered between the ectoderm and the endoderm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_25.wav,196484,the body of some animals can be divided externally and internally into segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_26.wav,405464,sometimes the segments in animals have serial repetition of some organs which is seen is earthworms this phenomenon is also known as metamerism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_27.wav,215710,one of the most important features for animal classification is the presence or absence of a notochord
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_28.wav,287600,some animals develop a rod like structure on the dorsal side during embryonic development which known as the notochord
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_29.wav,456456,animals with a notochord are called chordates while animals without a notochord are called non chordates members of phylum porifera to echinoderms are non chordates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_2.wav,574320,however with the help of basic fundamental features such as level of organisation symmetry cell organisation nature of coelom segmentation and notochord scientists have classified animals into various groups
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_30.wav,219890,we just studied how we can classify animals into different categories on the basis of some fundamental features
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_3.wav,422182,lets understand each of these basic fundamental features in detail level of organisation is the first basic fundamental feature that deals with the pattern of cell organisation in an animal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_4.wav,287600,there are four patterns of cell organisation cellular tissue organ and organ system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_5.wav,188962,sponges exhibit a cellular level of organisation where cells are loosely arranged
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_6.wav,425526,tissue level of organisation is more complex and is displayed in coelenterates here the cells that perform the same function are arranged into tissues
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_7.wav,470666,organ level of organisation is exhibited in members of platyhelminthes and other higher phyla here the tissues are grouped to form organs and each organ performs a particular function
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_8.wav,816736,the last cell pattern is the organ system level of organisation here the organs are associated with one another to form a functional system where each system performs a specific physiological function animals like annelids arthropods molluscs echinoderms and chordates exhibit this level of organisation organ systems can also differ in complexity in various animal groups
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/animal_classification_9.wav,375372,for example platyhelminthes have an incomplete digestive system where a single opening outside the body serves as both the mouth and the anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_02.wav,181438,in this module you will learn about asexual reproduction in organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_03.wav,434722,our earth is home to countless plant and animal species all of which have a limited life span and are bound to die yet these species have existed for several thousands of years
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_04.wav,192306,thats because living organisms can reproduce that is they give rise to offspring
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_05.wav,353638,which in turn grow and reproduce their own offspring of the same kind this ensures survival of the species generation after generation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_06.wav,235772,in living organisms we see two types of reproduction sexual and asexual
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_07.wav,270046,in sexual reproduction a gamete from the male parent fuses with a gamete from the female parent to form a zygote
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_08.wav,416332,however in asexual reproduction the organism or the parent cell divides to give rise to morphologically and genetically identical organisms called clones
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_09.wav,314350,asexual reproduction commonly seen in protists monerans and fungi is of many different types
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_10.wav,353638,the amoeba for instance reproduces by binary fission where the parent cell divides into two halves and each half develops into a daughter cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_11.wav,175586,likewise bacteria too reproduce through binary fission
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_12.wav,268374,yeast on the other hand reproduces through budding where the parent cell produces small buds through mitosis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_13.wav,235772,these buds initially remain attached to the parent cell and then separate to develop into new organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_14.wav,398778,while yeast reproduces through budding other members of the fungi kingdom such as penicilium reproduce through conida a special asexual reproductive structure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_15.wav,272554,apart from fungi we also see asexual reproductive structures in certain members of kindgom animalia
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_16.wav,234938,in the case of hydra buds which develop on the parent body serve as a means of reproduction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_17.wav,291780,likewise the sponge produces internal buds called gemmules that aid in asexual reproduction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_18.wav,394598,apart from single celled organisms and animals asexual reproduction is also seen in simple plants such as algae as well as in certain higher plants such as potato
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_19.wav,314350,for instance chlamydomonas a type of algae develops zoospores which later mature into new plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_20.wav,353638,however during unfavourable conditions chlamydomonas as well as other types of fungi and algae undergo sexual reproduction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_21.wav,461470,in higher plants asexual reproduction commonly known as vegetative propagation takes place through vegetative propagules specialised structures which emerge from different parts of the plant
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_22.wav,306826,for instance the stem of a potato plant is dotted with buds known as eyes which later germinate into new plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_23.wav,330232,whereas in a ginger plant modified stems or rhizomes having nodes and buds act as a means of vegetative propagation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_24.wav,392926,while the buds develop into a new ginger plant the nodes of the rhizome give way to adventitious roots which help in the absorption of water and minerals from the soil
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_25.wav,372864,bryophyllum on the other hand have notches on the margin of their leaves that give rise to adventitious buds that fall off and later germinate into new plantlets
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_26.wav,387074,apart from buds and nodes runners suckers offsets and bulbs are other examples of vegetative propagules in plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_27.wav,388746,interestingly farmers and gardeners make full use of vegetative propagation for commercial cultivation of various plants including strawberry potatoes and ginger
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_28.wav,716426,vegetative propagation however can turn into a problem in certain cases like the fishermen of bengal have discovered water hyacinth an aquatic plant with a phenomenal rate of vegetative propagation is choking the bay of bengal and killing millions of fish thereby ruining the livelihood of the fishing community
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/asexual_reprod_29.wav,321872,asexual reproduction an important biological process that ensures continuity of life occurs differently in different organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_10.wav,218218,due to the increasing demand for honey bee keeping is done both on a small scale and large scale
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_11.wav,214876,in small scale bee keeping one or two apiaries are kept in verandas or on rooftops
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_12.wav,164720,whereas in large scale bee keeping many apiaries are used
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_14.wav,177258,bee keeping is usually practised near fruit plantations and cultivated fields
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_15.wav,188962,honeybees act as pollinators by helping crops like sunflower during flowering
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_17.wav,188962,as a result farmers get a high yield in terms of crops as well as honey
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_18.wav,244132,the most commonly reared honeybee species is apis indica also called the indian bee
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_20.wav,177258,it does require some knowledge and training that is provided by certain organisations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_28.wav,255000,and relates to the rearing catching and selling of aquatic animals such as fish and shellfish
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_29.wav,191470,as fish contain more proteins and less fat they are preferred to other meats
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_30.wav,231594,most commonly eaten freshwater fish include catla rohu and the common carp
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_31.wav,188126,while marine fish include hilsa mackerel and pomfret
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_32.wav,335248,fisheries also provide products such as cod liver oil which is a nutritional supplement and pearl oysters that have commercial value
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_33.wav,178094,consequently it forms the livelihood of many people in coastal areas of india
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_34.wav,218218,as seafood like fish prawn crab and lobster are always in demand
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_35.wav,226578,several techniques like aquaculture and pisciculture are employed to increase their yield
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_36.wav,174750,aquaculture is the cultivation of aquatic animals and plants for food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_37.wav,166392,whereas pisciculture refers specifically to fish farming
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_38.wav,355310,this dramatic increase in seafood production was called the blue revolution compared to the green revolution that brought about an increase in agricultural production
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_3.wav,214876,animal husbandry includes bee keeping and fisheries in addition to cattle and poultry farming
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_4.wav,203172,bee keeping also known as apiculture is the rearing of honeybees
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_5.wav,188962,in artificial beehives called apiaries for the commercial production of honey
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_6.wav,173080,honey is highly nutritious and an important constituent of several medicines
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bee_keeping_7.wav,194812,also the apiaries in which honeybees live and nurture their young ones
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_10.wav,467322,unfortunately many nations believe that this type of conservation is unrealistic and uneconomical and so a number of species that need to be saved from extinction outnumber the conservational aid available
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_11.wav,547570,to solve this problem on a global scale conservationists have identified biodiversity hotspots in the world initially there were 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world which was later increased to 34
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_12.wav,397106,though these 34 biodiversity hotspots cover less than 2 per cent of the earths land area they are inhabited by an extremely large number of species and a high degree of endemism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_13.wav,224906,the term endemism relates to species that are confined to a particular region and not found elsewhere
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_14.wav,195648,for example many species of lemur are endemic to madagascar island
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_15.wav,186454,likewise the lion tailed macaque is endemic to the western ghats of india
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_16.wav,430542,our country too is rich in biodiversity with three biodiversity hotspots which include the western ghats himalayas and indo burma region
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_17.wav,396270,regions with unique ecology and rich biodiversity are legally protected as biosphere reserves national parks and sanctuaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_18.wav,389582,as of today we have 14 biosphere reserves 90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries in our country
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_19.wav,238280,moreover indian religious beliefs and cultural traditions have always emphasised protection of nature
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_20.wav,439738,for example animals such as the elephant and cow and trees such as peepal and banyan are prohibited from being killed as people think gods and goddess reside in them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_21.wav,309334,moreover in many cultures trees and wildlife within tracts of forests called sacred groves were respected and protected
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_22.wav,536704,such sacred groves are found in the khasi and jaintia hills in meghalaya aravalli hills of rajasthan western ghats of maharashtra and karnataka and the sarguja and bastar areas of chhattisgarh
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_23.wav,207352,the sacred groves in meghalaya provide protection to a large number of rare and threatened plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_24.wav,230758,in this way we can provide in situ conservation to many plants and animals in their natural habitat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_25.wav,466486,however at times endangered plants and animals need to be taken away from their natural habitat and placed in a special care centre this method of conservation is known as ex situ conservation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_26.wav,326052,wildlife safari parks zoological parks botanical gardens and seed and gene banks serve this purpose
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_27.wav,287600,in fact many animals are threatened or extinct in the wild but they continue to live safely in zoological parks
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_28.wav,379550,for instance in india the population of the one horned rhino drastically decreased due to destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled poaching of its horn
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_29.wav,180602,but now it has been specially taken care of in the kaziranga national park
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_2.wav,167228,in this module you will learn about ways to conserve biodiversity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_30.wav,369520,in the last couple of years several advancements were made in ex situ conservation now plants are propagated using tissue culture methods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_31.wav,276732,and gametes of threatened species are preserved in viable and fertile condition using cryopreservation techniques
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_32.wav,295960,in addition seed banks are used to preserve seeds of different genetic strains of commercially important plants for a long time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_33.wav,224070,ex situ and in situ conservation are thus used to protect and preserve our rich biodiversity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_34.wav,288436,as biological wealth is not confined to political boundaries its conservation is the collective responsibility of all nations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_35.wav,568468,in 1992 the convention on biological diversity also known as the earth summit was held in rio de janeiro in which all nations were asked to take appropriate measures to conserve biodiversity and sustainably utilise its benefits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_36.wav,789986,in a follow up the world summit on sustainable development was held in 2002 in johannesburg south africa at this summit 190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global regional and local levels by 2010
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_37.wav,350294,ways to conserve our biodiversity are endless but it is important that we take earnest measures towards its protection and preservation before its too late
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_3.wav,189798,imagine a world without birds plants or your favourite animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_4.wav,214040,this will be a reality if we do not take any measures to stop the loss of biodiversity on earth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_5.wav,284256,in fact experts estimate that nearly 50 per cent of species on earth might be extinct within the next 100 years
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_7.wav,428034,conservation of biodiversity can be done is two ways in situ or on site and ex situ or off site let us understand these two methods in detail
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_8.wav,390418,in in situ conservation we conserve and protect the entire ecosystem in other words its biodiversity is protected at all levels
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biodiversity_9.wav,247476,for example to save tigers we need to save the forests which are home to these vulnerable creatures
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_10.wav,279240,further they involve the exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_11.wav,210696,now let us look at the differences between photosynthesis and respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_12.wav,453948,photosynthesis is exclusively exhibited by green plants algae and photosynthetic bacteria while respiration is observed in all living organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_13.wav,317692,also photosynthesis occurs only in those cells which possess chloroplasts with the pigment chlorophyll
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_14.wav,317692,on the other hand respiration occurs in all living cells either in their cytoplasm or mitochondria
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_15.wav,566796,as far as the processes are concerned in photosynthesis simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide and water combine together to release a complex compound glucose by the process of anabolism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_16.wav,474846,whereas in respiration the complex compound glucose is broken down into simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide and water by the process of catabolism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_17.wav,675466,thus photosynthesis utilises carbon dioxide and releases oxygen that all living organisms need to respire while respiration utilises oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide for organisms which are green to photosynthesise
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_18.wav,324380,next in terms of energy light energy is converted into chemical energy and stored during photosynthesis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_19.wav,413824,whereas in respiration the chemical energy is partly converted into usable energy for various activities and the rest is converted into heat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_20.wav,277568,photosynthesis takes place in two steps namely light reaction and dark reaction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_21.wav,631998,in the light reaction sunlight is used to form oxygen and the energy sources namely adenosine triphosphate or atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate or nadph
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_22.wav,262522,in the dark reaction the carbon dioxide is converted into glucose using energy sources
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_23.wav,395434,on the other hand respiration takes place in three steps namely glycolysis krebs cycle and electron transport
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_24.wav,200664,glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose in the cytoplasm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_25.wav,829276,then the end products produced in glycolysis are moved from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion in krebs cycle which involves the production of energy sources such as nadh or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide fadh2 or flavin adenine dinucleotide
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_26.wav,255836,lastly electron transport involves the generation of atp from these energy sources
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_27.wav,533360,the next difference between photosynthesis and respiration is that all photosynthetic reactions utilise energy in the form of atp and nadph hence it is an endothermic reaction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_28.wav,297630,while in respiration energy is released in the form of atp and hence its an exothermic reaction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_29.wav,518314,next photosynthesis is of three types namely c3 c4 and cam based on which plants synthesise carbohydrates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_2.wav,275062,in this module you will learn about the differences between photosynthesis and respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_30.wav,255836,while respiration is of two types namely aerobic and anaerobic
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_31.wav,508282,let us look at the next difference between photosynthesis and respiration in photosynthesis there is a gain in dry weight of the plant due to the synthesis of food which is accumulated in the plant
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_32.wav,396270,however in respiration there is a loss of dry weight of the plant due to the breakdown of food and the escape of carbon dioxide formed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_33.wav,562618,we shall now look at the differences between the factors affecting the two processes the factors affecting photosynthesis are concentration of carbon dioxide intensity of temperature and water availability
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_34.wav,328560,on the other hand the factors affecting respiration are concentration of oxygen glucose and atp
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_35.wav,415496,another difference between photosynthesis and respiration is that the former takes place only in the presence of light while the latter occurs at all times
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_36.wav,350294,next the rate of photosynthetic activity is more during midday as the plants are exposed to bright sunlight during noon
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_37.wav,397106,at this time since the intensity of light is high the uptake of carbon dioxide is also high followed by greater amount of oxygen release
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_38.wav,195648,the rate of respiration fluctuates as per the amount of the energy required
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_39.wav,331904,we have now learnt about some major differences between the two metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_3.wav,399612,did you know that the metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration help to maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide on earth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_4.wav,169736,let us look at the two processes in a little more detail
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_5.wav,432214,to begin with photosynthesis is a process during which plants produce their own food using atmospheric carbon dioxide and energy from sunlight
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_6.wav,318528,on the other hand respiration is the process of breakdown of complex food molecules to produce energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_7.wav,529180,photosynthesis and respiration are therefore inevitable metabolic processes in green plants as the former provides food as well as oxygen whereas the latter produces energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_8.wav,259178,by comparing the two we can identify similarities and differences between them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/bio_respiration_9.wav,298466,the main similarity between photosynthesis and respiration is that they occur only in living cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_10.wav,492400,first let us take the case of carbohydrates carbohydrates provide instant energy required by the body to perform work and are therefore termed as instant energy sources
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_11.wav,463978,second comes fats which are stored in the body for future use as they yield more energy compared to other nutrients and are hence termed as high energy reserves
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_12.wav,397106,next comes proteins that aid in growth and repair of wornout body parts and hence are called building blocks of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_13.wav,356982,lastly vitamins and minerals provide resistance against diseases and are hence considered to be protective substances
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_14.wav,750698,thus based on the type of nutrients present food can be classified into energygiving food which includes carbohydrates and fats bodybuilding food which includes proteins and finally protective food which includes vitamins and minerals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_15.wav,570976,carbohydrates fats and proteins make up a large portion of our diet and are called macronutrients while vitamins and minerals occupy a small portion of our diet and are called micronutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_16.wav,428870,both macronutrients and micronutrients provided by food are utilised by the cells which are fundamental units of all the organs in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_17.wav,215710,inside the cells these nutrients are oxidised to release energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_18.wav,333576,then this energy is utilised to perform various metabolic activities of the cell and that of the organism as a whole
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_19.wav,220726,as far as energy is concerned do we need energy while sleeping and resting
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_20.wav,447260,we indeed require energy while sleeping and resting as our body needs to perform the basic metabolic activities such as respiration and circulation in that state as well
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_21.wav,596054,apart from respiration and circulation metabolic activities that occur in our body include digestion excretion growth reproduction and so on which are conducted by various organ systems
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_22.wav,505774,human beings generally eat food three times a day at periodic intervals the first meal of the day is breakfast in the morning followed by lunch in the afternoon and finally dinner at night
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_23.wav,261686,with regards to availability of food it can be obtained from both plant and animal sources
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_24.wav,323544,the food provided by plants is called plant food while the food provided by animals is called animal food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_25.wav,378716,thus food is a nutritious substance obtained from plant and animal sources that is required for the proper functioning of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_4.wav,383730,you will feel weak tired and unable to perform any work so is there a relationship between eating food and doing work
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_5.wav,355310,certainly a relation can be drawn between both as you can work energetically only when you eat food regularly
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_6.wav,341098,so what is food food is any edible substance which provides nutrition to maintain life and growth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_7.wav,294288,the process by which our body obtains food and utilises it for growth and development is called nutrition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_8.wav,405464,nutrition aids in availing a variety of nutrients nutrients are the chemical substances present in food required for growth and good health
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/biotic_activities_9.wav,347786,the nutrients required by our body are carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins and minerals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_12.wav,249148,animals selected for inbreeding are of superior quality and are closely related for four to six generations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_13.wav,356146,a superior quality cow is one that produces more milk and a superior bull is one that is a strong draught animal and gives rise to superior offspring
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_14.wav,188962,subsequently mating is carried out between offspring which have superior qualities
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_15.wav,371192,thus inbreeding increases homozygosity in animals that is it results in a pure line of animals with desired characters
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_16.wav,196484,this is similar to mendels experiment that yielded homozygous pure lines in pea plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_17.wav,258342,inbreeding also helps in the expression of desirable characters and the elimination of undesirable characters in the offspring
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_18.wav,234938,however inbreeding can increase the chance of expression of recessive genes which are harmful
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_19.wav,216546,if inbreeding among closely related breeds is continued it can result in inbreeding depression
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_22.wav,280076,out breeding can be carried out in three ways out crossing cross breeding and interspecific hybridisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_23.wav,309334,out crossing is mating between animals of the same breed but with no common ancestors for up to four to six generations on either side
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_25.wav,351130,cross breeding is mating between animals of superior quality belonging to different breeds to produce hybrids possessing superior qualities of both their parents
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_26.wav,271718,for example jersey with a long lactation period and red sindhi with high disease resistance are mated
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_28.wav,188962,the new breed obtained is then subject to inbreeding to increase the herd population
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_29.wav,336920,another example of cross breeding is the cross between bikaneri ewes and marino rams to form a new sheep breed hisardale
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_30.wav,259178,the third type of out breeding is interspecific hybridisation where animals of two different species are mated
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_31.wav,238280,for example mating between a male donkey and a female horse to form a new breed a mule
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_32.wav,166392,although most new breeds are infertile they have high economic value
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_33.wav,347786,both inbreeding and out breeding can also be carried out using controlled breeding experiments artificial insemination is one such method
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_34.wav,180602,in artificial insemination semen is first collected from the superior male
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_35.wav,168900,the semen is then injected into the reproductive tract or vagina of the female animal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_37.wav,374536,thus artificial insemination is carried out to overcome problems in natural breeding and also to carry out mating between animals that are geographically separated
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_38.wav,461470,however the success of animal breeding using artificial insemination is low and so new techniques like multiple ovulation embryo transfer technology or moet were developed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_39.wav,261686,moet involves the administration of gonadotrophic hormones like fsh and lh to female animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_3.wav,322708,animal breeding is the controlled propagation of animals to achieve desirable qualities of farm animals and increase the yield of these animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_42.wav,247476,the super ovulated female is mated with a superior male either through natural mating or artificial insemination
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_44.wav,208188,when the fertilised eggs reach the eight to 32 cell stage they are non surgically removed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_45.wav,242460,and then implanted into different surrogate mothers for further development in a process called embryo transfer
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_47.wav,271718,in this manner moet helps increase the herd population containing desirable characters in a short span of time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_48.wav,218218,moet is widely carried out in animals such as cattle buffaloes and sheep
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_49.wav,440572,so different techniques such as artificial insemination and moet along with various inbreeding and out breeding methods are employed in animal breeding to produce offspring with superior qualities
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_4.wav,433050,the term breed refers to a group of animals within a species related by ancestors and possessing many similar characters such as appearance behaviour and size
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_5.wav,242460,for example jersey and leghorn are very popular breeds of cattle and chicken used for breeding
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_6.wav,224070,animal breeding is divided into two main categories inbreeding and out breeding
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_7.wav,191470,inbreeding is breeding between animals belonging to the same breed with a common ancestor
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/breeding_8.wav,171408,whereas out breeding is breeding between animals belonging to different breeds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_10.wav,290944,this modified form of cell theory has been given the status of cell principle or cell doctrine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_11.wav,209860,thus the major features of cell theory can be stated as follows
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_12.wav,214040,every living organism is composed of one or more cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_13.wav,194812,the cell is the basic structural unit of all living organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_14.wav,236608,activities performed by the cell result in the activities performed by an organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_15.wav,261686,all cells originate only from preexisting cells through cell division
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_16.wav,236608,let us now look at the cell theory in detail referring to its fundamental features
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_17.wav,395434,firstly cells are the structural units of life bodies of all living organisms are made up of cells and its components
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_18.wav,205680,living organisms can be singlecelled or multicelled
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_19.wav,411316,a single cell represents the entire body in a unicellular organism whereas numerous cells make up the body in a multicellular organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_20.wav,677974,secondly cells are the functional units of life in a body each cell is independent and performs all the basic life processes like nutrition respiration excretion growth and reproduction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_21.wav,332740,in fact each cell not only functions independently but also as an integral part of the organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_22.wav,576828,thirdly life originates as a single cell during the process of fertilisation a male gamete and a female gamete fuse together and give rise to a single cell called zygote
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_23.wav,321036,this zygote develops into a multicelled embryo which further develops into a fullfledged organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_24.wav,438066,lastly all cells originate from preexisting cells each cell undergoes the process of cell division to give rise to a new cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_25.wav,178094,let us now throw light on some of the exceptions of the cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_26.wav,356982,do you know that the discovery of virus revealed that it does not have a nucleus and cytoplasm this makes it an exception to the cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_27.wav,413824,likewise mature mammalian rbcs and the sieve tube elements of phloem cells in plants do not possess nuclei like that of a cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_28.wav,331068,similarly blue green algae and some bacteria do not have a true nucleus which is usually present in a cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_29.wav,357818,in addition fungi like rhizopus exhibit protoplasm with many nuclei this is called coenocytic condition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_2.wav,182274,in this module you will learn about cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_30.wav,199828,these coenocytes do not show an organisation like that of a cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_31.wav,273390,to sum up though most cells follow the cell theory some cells are found to be exceptional
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_32.wav,520822,over time numerous new discoveries related to the structure and function of the cell by je purkinje von mohl waldeyer and so on have led to the modification of the basic cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_33.wav,152182,which came to be known as the modern cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_34.wav,229086,let us look at the additional principles that were incorporated to form the modern cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_35.wav,472338,one of the points of the modern cell theory states that during cell division the chromosomes inside the nucleus duplicate themselves to produce exact replicas of the parent nucleus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_36.wav,283420,this nuclear division is followed by cytoplasmic division and gives rise to two daughter cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_37.wav,264194,the modern cell theory also states that some cells have an exceptional feature of totipotency
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_38.wav,550914,totipotency is the capacity or the potential of a living nucleated cell to differentiate itself into any type of cell in the body as required this makes it possible to form a complete new organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_39.wav,229086,as per the modern cell theory unicellular organisms follow cellular grade of organisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_3.wav,346114,do you know that all life originates as a single cell a cell is the smallest microscopic unit in any living organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_40.wav,199828,while multicellular organisms follow organ grade of organisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_41.wav,304318,thus the cell theory that describes the properties of a cell is an important discovery in biological science
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_4.wav,493236,the scientific contributions of three wellknown german scientists matthias jacob schleiden theodor schwann and rudolph virchow led to the postulation of the cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_5.wav,494072,in the year 1838 matthias jacob schleiden a botanist proclaimed that all plants are made up of a large number of cells each performing various life processes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_6.wav,711410,then in the year 1839 theodor schwann a zoologist experimented on connective tissues such as bone and cartilage and confirmed the presence of nucleus surrounded by cytoplasm and cell membrane which is nothing but a cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_7.wav,297630,he added to the cell theory by stating that along with plants animals are also made up of cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_8.wav,530852,later in the year 1858 twenty years after the postulation of the cell theory scientist rudolf virchow discovered that a cell divides itself and gives rise to new cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cell_theory_9.wav,412152,he added this knowledge to the cell theory by stating omnis cellulae cellula which means all cells arise from preexisting cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_0.wav,270882,it was a clear bright day in 1942 when several german children saw the focke wulf fly over a corn field in bavaria they saluted the german fighter plane excited about reporting the sighting in class tomorrow
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_10.wav,243296,hitler believed in the age old gender divide men were warriors and women were homemakers his policies encouraged women to drop out of university and the work force
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_11.wav,474010,girls were taught to get married at a young age keep a good home and have as many pure aryan children as possible
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_12.wav,243296,this would ensure a continuous supply of strong soldiers and workers required to expand nazi germany
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_13.wav,224070,newly married couples got government loans for each child they had they didn t need to pay back 25 percent of the loan four children meant the entire loan was free
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_14.wav,439738,august 12th was hitlers mothers birthday and each year on this day he awarded the motherhood cross to women who had given birth to the largest number of children the gold cross went to women who had produced 8 children silver was for 6 children and bronze was for 4 children
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_15.wav,702216,women who maintained contact with jews poles or russians were put in trucks and paraded through town with shaved heads to shame them opposition was not an option in the police state of nazi germany
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_16.wav,521658,every german that survived between 1933 and 1945 in nazi germany did so because they were influenced by hitlers nazi ideology
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_17.wav,370356,as hitler believed it was every germans duty to assure the future of the german race he made sure nazi propaganda reached every german
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_1.wav,588530,these children didn t go to any ordinary school they were a part of the deutsches jungvolk or german youth especially set up by the nazi regime in 1930 all german boys aged 10 to 14 years were a part of the jungvolk
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_2.wav,631162,here they learnt to differentiate between friendly and enemy aircrafts they also learnt why a pure aryan race was required to keep their country safe their text books were filled with anti semitic stereotypes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_3.wav,550078,they were encouraged to be mentally and physically tough and play combat sports emotional weakness was frowned on and as they swore their loyalty to hitler they dreamt of becoming a nazi soldier to defend the third reich
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_4.wav,540884,these jungvolk helped hitler ensure that german children were schooled in the nazi way of thinking from childhood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_5.wav,264194,when the boys were between 14 to 18 years of age they joined the hitler youth a paramilitary organization established since 1922 by 1930 it had enrolled 25000 students
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_6.wav,529180,these boys were selected to become aryan supermen who would fight as faithful soldiers of the third reich
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_7.wav,223234,they were trained in weapon usage assault and basic tactics the concept of war was glorified and the concept of democracy condemned aggression and violence were promoted as tools for eliminating anti nazi and anti aryan german citizens
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_8.wav,669614,after the age of 18 the german youth that did not score well joined the labour service where they were asked to serve in the armed forces or nazi government while top scorers channelled their energy towards war practice in the nazi army
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/children_women_9.wav,587694,nazi girls were schooled in the nazi league of german girls to become good mothers and nurture the aryan supermen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_10.wav,411316,the capillaries then combine to form smaller structures called venules which in turn collate to increase in size and then form veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_11.wav,354474,thus arteries branch progressively decreasing in size while veins unite progressively increasing in size
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_12.wav,438902,as far as the location of arteries and veins is concerned the arteries are deepseated inside the body while the veins are superficially located near the skin
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_13.wav,639522,next with respect to the nature of blood transported all the arteries except for the pulmonary artery circulate pure blood on the other hand all the veins except for the pulmonary vein transport impure blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_14.wav,394598,in view of direction of blood flow arteries transport blood from the heart to all the organs while veins transport viceversa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_15.wav,562618,let us now consider the colour of arteries and veins arteries are bright red in colour as they carry oxygen rich blood whereas veins are dark red as they carry blood deficient in oxygen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_16.wav,209024,we shall now look into some major structural differences between arteries and veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_17.wav,527508,to begin with the walls of arteries are thick muscular and highly elastic while those of the veins are thin less muscular and not as elastic as the walls of arteries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_18.wav,234938,in addition the muscularity determines the nature of the walls of arteries and veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_19.wav,462306,the walls of the arteries are non collapsible due to the welldeveloped musculature whereas the walls in veins are collapsible due to the lack of welldeveloped muscles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_20.wav,422182,further the walls of arteries and veins are made up of three concentric layers called tunica externa tunica media and tunica interna
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_21.wav,249148,arteries have well developed tunica media but lesser developed tunica externa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_22.wav,307662,on the other hand veins have comparatively less developed tunica media but welldeveloped tunica externa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_23.wav,577664,in the context of special structures present inside arteries do not have any valves to regulate the flow of blood while veins possess valves to regulate the flow of blood as well as to prevent the backward flow of blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_24.wav,320200,next if we compare the lumina arteries have quite a narrow lumen while veins have a wide lumen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_25.wav,423018,since the lumen of the artery is narrow blood flows at a high speed and under great pressure whereas it flows slowly and with low pressure in veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_26.wav,414660,additionally arteries exhibit the features of constriction and dilation to control blood flow veins do exhibit dilation but not constriction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_27.wav,235772,thus we have looked at some of the major differences between arteries and veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_2.wav,227414,in this module you will learn about the differences between arteries and veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_4.wav,290944,you will see that the pipes that supply clean drinking water are separate from the pipes that carry sewage water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_5.wav,325216,similarly our body has one type of blood vessels carrying pure blood and another type carrying impure blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_6.wav,315186,the blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart into the various organs of the body are called arteries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_7.wav,377044,on the other hand the blood vessels that collect deoxygenated blood from the various organs of the body and bring it back to the heart are called veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_8.wav,203172,there are many differences between arteries and veins let us look at them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_arteries_veins_9.wav,265866,do you know arteries branch into small arterioles which further branch into smaller capillaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_10.wav,470666,all arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart except for the pulmonary artery which carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for purification
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_11.wav,389582,the three main characteristics of arteries are that they have thick muscular walls a narrow lumen and blood flowing in spurts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_12.wav,349458,arteries have thick muscular walls to withstand the force exerted by the oxygenated blood when flushed out from the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_13.wav,407972,a narrow space inside the arteries called the lumen is able to maintain the blood at a high pressure with which it is supplied to the organs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_14.wav,452276,lastly blood in the arteries flows in spurts which enables the blood to flow in one direction since arteries do not have any valves to control the flow
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_15.wav,228250,this flow of blood in spurts is due to the ventricular contractions of the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_16.wav,273390,due to the flow of blood at high pressure inside the arteries they are located deep under the skin
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_17.wav,176422,let us now deal with the second type of blood vessels the veins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_18.wav,322708,veins are those blood vessels which collect blood from the various organs of the body and bring it back to the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_19.wav,392090,all veins carry deoxygenated blood from the organs except for the pulmonary vein which carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_20.wav,469830,the four main characteristics of veins are that they have thin and less muscular walls a wider lumen the presence of semilunar valves and the smooth flow of blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_21.wav,296796,veins have thin and less muscular walls as blood flows through them with less speed and at low pressure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_22.wav,452276,as the walls are thin and less elastic veins have a wider lumen so as to carry all the deoxygenated blood from different organs of the body towards the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_23.wav,359488,further veins have semilunar valves that allow the blood to flow in only one direction preventing the backflow of blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_24.wav,270046,these semilunar valves get opened by the force of the blood flowing from the organs towards the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_25.wav,355310,as far as the location is concerned due to the flow of blood at low pressure inside the veins they are located superficially under the skin
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_26.wav,198992,we shall now look into the third type of blood vessels the capillaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_27.wav,345278,capillaries are microscopic vessels formed by the further branching of arterioles which are the finer branches of arteries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_28.wav,214040,capillaries are made up of a single layer of squamous epithelial cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_29.wav,268374,the main function of capillaries is to carry oxygenated blood from the arterioles to the surrounding tissues
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_2.wav,184782,in this module you will learn about the types of blood vessels
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_30.wav,377880,in the tissue there is an exchange of nutrients and oxygen with nitrogenous wastes and carbon dioxide through the single layer of capillaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_31.wav,224906,the lumen of the capillary is very thin as compared to that of the artery
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_32.wav,377044,numerous capillaries from the tissue unite to form common branches called venules which further unite to form a larger vein
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_33.wav,367848,the wall of the capillaries is made up of single layer of cells hence making it thinner to facilitate exchange of materials in the tissues
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_34.wav,230758,let us now look at some additional features of arteries veins and capillaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_35.wav,336920,with regards to the anatomy of the blood vessels both arteries and veins have walls made up of three concentric layers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_36.wav,387910,these three concentric layers are the inner tunica interna middle tunica media and the outermost tunica externa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_37.wav,498252,tunica interna is made up of flat endothelial cellsthis layer is internally lined by an elastic membrane which reduces the friction between the blood and the walls
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_38.wav,453112,next tunica media is made up of smooth non striated muscle fibres and elastic connective tissue which is responsible for contraction and dilation of blood vessels
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_39.wav,300974,these smooth muscles are responsible for vasoconstriction and vasodilation of blood vessels
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_3.wav,241624,blood vessels are branched tubes which carry blood from and to the heart in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_40.wav,369520,lastly tunica externa is made up of loosely arranged elastic collagen fibres which protects arteries from external pressure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_41.wav,504938,it must be remembered that though arteries and veins have similar structures in their walls the thick walls of arteries are well developed with elastic connective tissue this makes them non collapsible
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_42.wav,319364,on the contrary the thin walls of the veins are loosely arranged collagen fibres which make them collapsible
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_43.wav,317692,next an additional feature of blood vessels especially arteries is that they can contract or dilate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_44.wav,292616,the contraction of a blood vessel to decrease the blood supply to a particular part of the body is called vasoconstriction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_45.wav,332740,on the other hand the dilation of the blood vessel to increase the blood supply to a particular part of the body is called vasodilation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_46.wav,395434,thus each type of blood vessel with its specific structure and characteristics plays a significant role in circulating blood to all parts of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_5.wav,184782,they carry vital nutrients and oxygen to all the cells of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_6.wav,548406,apart from carrying nutrients and oxygen they also drive unwanted materials like carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes towards the excretory organs such as lungs and kidneys respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_7.wav,253328,blood vessels are of three typesarteries veins and capillaries
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cir_system_blood_vessels_9.wav,264194,arteries are those blood vessels which carry blood away from the heart to the various organs of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_0.wav,198156,in this module you will learn about clothing and different notions of beauty
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_10.wav,471502,although wearing stays and corsets was painful women were compelled to do so since it was believed that tightly laced women with small waists were attractive elegant and graceful
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_11.wav,454784,however not all women wanted these sufferings by the 1830s in england the suffrage movement gathered momentum and women started campaigning for dress reforms as well
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_12.wav,300974,several articles by the reformers were published in womens magazines describing the ill effects of corsets on bodily development
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_13.wav,288436,even doctors reported that many women who wore corsets experienced weakness and lethargy and fainted frequently
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_15.wav,326052,women criticised their long skirts and voluminous traditional clothes since it accumulated dirt and also hampered free movement
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_16.wav,472338,the first dress reformer mrs amelia bloomer launched loose tunics that could be worn over ankle length trousers the trousers were known as bloomers or knickerbockers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_17.wav,192306,in the 1870s two associations strongly campaigned for dress reform
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_18.wav,217382,these were the national woman suffrage association headed by mrs stanton and
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_19.wav,161376,the american woman suffrage association commanded by lucy stone
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_1.wav,331068,the french revolution ended the sumptuary laws however it did not ensure that everyone had a similar clothing style
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_20.wav,196484,they demanded simple dresses and short skirts and the abandonment of corsets
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_21.wav,194812,both in europe and america women began a movement for rational dress reform
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_22.wav,168064,initially the reformers faced a lot of opposition from the conservative women
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_24.wav,219054,however by the end of the nineteenth century the notion of beauty and clothing changed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_2.wav,467322,the poor still could not dress or eat like the rich it was a persons earnings that determined what he or she could wear and so different classes of people developed their own styles of dressing
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_3.wav,288436,this is how the notion of what was beautiful or ugly proper or improper decent or vulgar differed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_4.wav,204008,the clothing styles of men and women reflected what was expected out of them by society
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_5.wav,243296,while men presented themselves as serious strong independent and aggressive
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_6.wav,208188,women were expected to be docile delicate frivolous and passive
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_7.wav,203172,women in victorian england were therefore groomed accordingly since their childhood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_8.wav,163048,as girls they were dressed in stays that held their bodies straight
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/clothing_9.wav,323544,as they grew slightly older they wore tight fitting corsets which would make their waists appear smaller and give shape to their bodies
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_03.wav,663764,although a cockroach may look like a simple small insect anatomically it is quite complex lets take a look at the anatomical features of a cockroach such as the alimentary canal and the blood vascular respiratory excretory nervous and reproductive systems
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_04.wav,296796,the alimentary canal is present in the body cavity and is divided into foregut midgut and hindgut
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_05.wav,380386,the entire foregut is lined with cuticle and consists of a mouth which leads into a short tubular pharynx that continues into a narrow tubular oesophagus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_06.wav,222398,the oesophagus opens into a large sac like structure called a crop which stores food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_07.wav,249984,the crop is followed by a small conical gizzard or proventriculus which grinds the food particles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_08.wav,342770,the transverse section of the gizzard shows an outer thick layer of circular muscles and an inner thick layer of cuticle which forms six chitinous teeth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_09.wav,360324,at the junction of the foregut and midgut is a ring of six to eight tubules called hepatic or gastric caecae which secrete digestive juice
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_10.wav,392926,similarly at the junction of the midgut and hindgut is a ring of numerous filamentous yellow coloured malpighian tubules which function as excretory organs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_11.wav,484040,the midgut is followed by the hindgut which is broader and is divided into ileum colon and rectum the rectum opens to the exterior through a small aperture called the anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_14.wav,213204,with poorly developed blood vessels that open into a haemocoel or open body space
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_15.wav,348622,the visceral organs situated in this haemocoel are immersed in blood or haemolymph which consists of colourless plasma and haemocytes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_16.wav,540884,in a longitudinal section of the insect you will see a long muscular tube lying along the mid dorsal axis of the body this muscular tube is the heart which is differentiated into funnel shaped chambers with ostia on either side
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_17.wav,442244,these insects also possess sinuses or cavities in their body the haemolymph from these sinuses enters the heart through ostia and is pumped back into the sinuses anteriorly
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_18.wav,176422,the respiratory system also forms a part of the anatomical study of a cockroach
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_19.wav,317692,this system consists of a network of trachea that opens to the exterior through 10 pairs of spiracles which are located on the lateral side of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_22.wav,274226,which supply oxygen to all the parts of the body gaseous exchange in these tracheoles takes place through diffusion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_24.wav,270046,in cockroaches malpighian tubules situated at the junction of the midgut and hindgut serve as excretory organs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_25.wav,316858,each tubule is lined with ciliated and glandular cells which absorb nitrogenous wastes from the body and convert them into uric acid
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_26.wav,338590,this uric acid is then excreted through the hindgut as cockroaches excrete uric acid they are known as uricotelic animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_27.wav,276732,apart from malpighian tubules the fat body nephrocytes and urecose glands also help in excretion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_29.wav,301810,in the cockroach this system consists of a series of ganglia in each segment which is attached to a ventral nerve cord and a brain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_31.wav,296796,in the head the supra oesophageal ganglion represents the brain which supplies nerves to the antennae and the compound eyes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_32.wav,479026,did you know that if you cut off the head of a cockroach it can survive for almost a week well this is because the head holds a small part of the nervous system while a large part of this system is present in the thorax and abdomen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_33.wav,458964,besides a well developed nervous system cockroaches also have many sensory organs such as antennae eyes maxillary and labial palps and anal cerci
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_34.wav,244968,the head bears a pair of large compound eyes and each eye consists of about 2000 hexagonal ommatidia
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_35.wav,270046,these ommatidia form a mosaic vision of an object with low resolution this vision is also known as nocturnal vision
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_37.wav,182274,cockroaches are unisexual with well developed male and female reproductive systems
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_38.wav,267538,the male reproductive system consists of two testes which lie on the lateral sides of the fourth to sixth abdominal segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_39.wav,392926,from each testis arises a thin vas deferens the two vasa deferentia run posteriorly and open into the ejaculatory duct through a seminal vesicle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_40.wav,184782,the ejaculatory duct opens into the male gonopore situated below the anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_41.wav,631162,at the anterior end of the ejaculatory duct in the sixth and seventh abdominal segments is a mushroom shaped accessory reproductive gland consisting of small and long tubules the secretion from this gland nourishes sperm and helps in spermatophore formation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_42.wav,499924,in cockroaches the male gonapophysis or phallomere represents the external genitalia these phallomeres are asymmetrical structures made up of chitin and surround the male gonopore
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_43.wav,243296,sperm is stored in seminal vesicles and form spermatophores which are discharged during copulation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_44.wav,286764,the female reproductive system consists of two large ovaries which lie on the lateral sides of the second to sixth abdominal segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_45.wav,246640,each ovary consists of eight ovarian tubules or ovarioles containing beaded strings of developing ova
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_46.wav,348622,from each ovary arises an oviduct which joins to form a single common oviduct or vagina the vagina opens into the genital chamber
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_47.wav,249984,in the sixth segment a pair of spermatheca is present which also opens into the genital chamber
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_48.wav,162212,during copulation sperm is transferred through spermatophores
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_49.wav,311006,after copulation the female cockroach secretes a purse shaped capsule called an ootheca which contains the fertilised eggs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_50.wav,270882,the ootheca is a dark reddish to blackish brown coloured capsule which is about eight millimeters long
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_51.wav,285928,the female lays about nine to ten oothecae in cracks or crevices with high humidity and near a food source
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_53.wav,437230,interestingly in periplaneta americana the development of the insect is paurometabolous which means that development takes through the nymphal stage
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_54.wav,503266,a nymph looks quite similar to an adult and it moults around 13 times before it turns into an adult though the second last nymphal stage has wing pads only adult cockroaches have wings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/cockroach_55.wav,401284,we have just studied the anatomical features of a cockroach such as the alimentary canal and the blood vascular excretory nervous and reproductive systems
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_10.wav,263358,we were issued permits for grazing and the time of entry and departure were strictly monitored and limited
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_11.wav,326888,the permit specified the periods in which we could be legally within a forest if we overstayed we were liable to fines
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_12.wav,322708,the entire nomadic pastoral community in india was facing a tough time because the british were suspicious of and distrusted us
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_13.wav,482368,they felt that it was easy to control and monitor a settled population living in fixed areas with particular fields a settled population was seen as peaceable and law abiding
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_14.wav,339426,so to control the nomadic pastoralists and to immobilise them the british passed the criminal tribes act in 1871
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_15.wav,246640,even without committing a single act of crime we were identified to be criminal by nature and birth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_16.wav,321036,we were expected to live in fixed notified villages under strict supervision of the village police and were allowed to move only with a permit
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_17.wav,498252,our troubles did not end there the colonial government imposed various taxes on land canal water salt trade goods and even on animals to increase its revenue
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_19.wav,331068,initially contractors were appointed to collect the tax but they exploited us by collecting high amounts of taxes to increase their profits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_20.wav,392090,by the 1880s the government began collecting the taxes directly from us and a pass was issued to each pastoralist to enter a grazing tract
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_21.wav,310170,even today the elders in our community recount the stories of atrocities that their ancestors faced at the hands of the british
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_22.wav,234938,the british completely changed our lives and took total control of our freedom of movement and our livelihood

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_4.wav,355310,my knowledge is not through textbooks but through stories that have been passed down over centuries from one generation to the next by the word of mouth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_5.wav,529180,i am here to tell you about a turbulent period in the lives of not only the raikas but the entire nomadic pastoralist community of india this happened during the colonial rule of the british
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_6.wav,441408,the british viewed all uncultivated land as wasteland that did not earn any revenue nor render any agricultural produce and so they passed various wasteland rules
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_7.wav,421346,under these rules several areas of uncultivated land including many of our pastoral tracts were taken over and given to select individuals to cultivate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_8.wav,642030,even access to forests was snatched away from us the forest act was passed under which many of the forests that produced commercial timber like teak and sal were marked as reserved and we the pastoralists were barred from entering them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/colonial_rule_9.wav,499924,however some forests were demarcated as protected and only certain customary grazing rights were granted in these forests however our movements were greatly restricted and controlled
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_10.wav,453112,diarrhoea can be of two types namely acute diarrhoea which lasts for less than two weeks and chronic diarrhoea which lasts for more than four weeks
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_11.wav,587694,acute diarrhoea is caused by microorganisms like viruses such as rotavirus bacteria such as escherichia coli and protozoans such as giardia lamblia which contaminate food and water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_12.wav,260850,it can also be caused due to intolerance of the digestive system to food items containing gluten or lactose
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_13.wav,291780,on the other hand chronic diarrhoea is caused by inflammation or ulcers in the small intestine or large intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_14.wav,530016,an example of chronic diarrhoea is irritable bowel syndrome a condition in which there is the contraction and relaxation of intestinal muscles more often causing gas bloating and diarrhoea
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_15.wav,471502,the symptoms of diarrhoea include frequent passing of loose watery stools three or more times a day abdominal pain and cramps bloating vomiting and dehydration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_16.wav,280912,let us now learn about the other disease called enteritis caused by consuming contaminated food and water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_17.wav,351966,enteritis is derived from two words enteron which means intestine and itis which means inflammation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_18.wav,229086,thus enteritis is the inflammation of the inner lining of the small intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_19.wav,451440,however sometimes the inflammation includes even the inner linings of the stomach and large intestine therefore the disease is commonly called gastroenteritis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_20.wav,462306,enteritis is mainly caused by consuming food and water contaminated with bacteria such as escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and campylobacter jejuni
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_21.wav,346950,even toxins called enterotoxins secreted by some bacteria such as escherichia coli cause enteritis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_22.wav,599398,however it is also caused by infection due to viruses such as norovirus and adeno virus protozoans such as entamoeba histolytica and nematodes such as hookworms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_23.wav,289272,enteritis caused by entamoeba histolytica is called amoebiasis or amoebic dysentery
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_24.wav,214876,even ingestion of chemicals such as lead and antibiotics can trigger enteritis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_25.wav,431378,as these infectious agents interfere with the absorption of water by the intestine the patient may suffer from symptoms such as vomiting diarrhoea or constipation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_26.wav,263358,amoebiasis involves symptoms such as discharge of sticky fluid and blood along with loose motions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_27.wav,304318,since the intestinal lining is infected in enteritis the patient experiences abdominal pain and cramps
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_28.wav,237444,the patient also loses appetite all these factors generally lead to weight loss
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_29.wav,193978,many patients also experience fever during enteritis due to the infection
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_2.wav,194812,in this module you will learn about diarrhoea and enteritis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_30.wav,391254,both diarrhoea and enteritis lead to the loss of large amount of water from the body which in turn causes a serious health risk of dehydration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_31.wav,684662,due to dehydration the patient might also show additional symptoms like dry mouth and lips pale face sunken eyes excessive thirst headache dry skin fatigue sunken abdomen and less urination
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_32.wav,231594,the patient may also suffer from cold hands and feet as well as a slow pulse rate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_33.wav,318528,in both diarrhoea and enteritis the patient should seek immediate medical help if the symptoms are noticed for more than a day
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_35.wav,371192,since most of the symptoms of diarrhoea and enteritis are caused by dehydration the loss of electrolytes in the body due to dehydration needs to be addressed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_36.wav,463142,thus the patient is given oral rehydration solution or ors to restore the water and electrolytes such as sodium potassium and chloride lost from the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_37.wav,330232,diarrhoea and enteritis disturb the normal functioning of the intestine so the intestine cannot absorb the food properly
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_38.wav,285928,however sugar salt and water in ors can be absorbed by the linings of the intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_39.wav,219054,this simple cure has saved the lives of millions of children all over the world
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_3.wav,321872,do you know that in many countries including india fourfifths of all illnesses are those that are spread through contaminated water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_40.wav,570976,however ors only gives temporary relief and it is important to take medical help as diarrhoea and enteritis can be life threatening especially in ill or malnourished individuals and small children
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_41.wav,290944,further treatment of diarrhoea and enteritis includes administration of antibiotics to kill the infectious agents
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_42.wav,317692,considering the numerous illeffects of diarrhoea and enteritis it is advisable to take preventive measures to avoid them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_43.wav,487384,to begin with since consuming contaminated food and water are the main causes of diarrhoea and enteritis both these diseases can be prevented by maintaining proper sanitation and hygiene
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_44.wav,428034,it is very important to maintain personal cleanliness you should always wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet and before eating food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_45.wav,189798,further you should always consume only clean food and water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_46.wav,361996,for instance you should not drink water from outdoor wells unclean vessels or other water sources without boiling or filtering it
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_47.wav,237444,likewise you should eat food that has been cooked properly in a clean cooking area
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_48.wav,296796,moreover fruits and vegetables should be washed thoroughly with lukewarm water before being eaten or cooked
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_49.wav,225742,the food should always be covered so that flies and dust do not settle on it
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_4.wav,255836,diarrhoea and enteritis are two such common diseases that spread through contaminated food and water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_50.wav,273390,as the food sold by roadside vendors is not covered it is advisable to avoid eating such foods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_51.wav,346114,food waste domestic garbage and excretory wastes of pets or children should be immediately and appropriately disposed off
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_52.wav,531688,thus it can be seen that diarrhoea and enteritis transmitted through contaminated food and water can be prevented by eating clean food maintaining personal hygiene and keeping the surroundings clean
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_5.wav,422182,one way by which food gets contaminated is through houseflies which feed on contaminated waste and later sit on foodstuffs thereby contaminating them also
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_6.wav,209860,when someone eats such contaminated food he or she may get infected
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_7.wav,271718,let us now learn about the causes symptoms treatment and preventive measures for diarrhoea and enteritis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_8.wav,357818,do you know that in united states adults experience an average of one episode of diarrhoea per year while children have an average of two per year
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_diarrhoea_9.wav,276732,diarrhoea is a condition in which the patient suffers from frequent bowel movements with loose watery stools
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_10.wav,169736,one such external protection method is vaccination
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_11.wav,575992,vaccination is the administration of a killed or weakened harmless variant of a diseasecausing microbe into the body of an individual in order to stimulate an immune response against pathogenic microbes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_12.wav,379550,this immune response activates lymphocytes and generates antibodies to kill the pathogens and clear them from the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_13.wav,380386,apart from antibodies it also produces memory lymphocytic cells in the body namely blymphocytes which are retained in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_14.wav,401284,so if the vaccinated individual is attacked by a similar pathogen these b memory cells have the property of recognising the pathogens and killing them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_15.wav,407972,thus the vaccinated person does not contract the disease as active immunity provided by vaccination lasts for many years in an individuals life time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_16.wav,224070,this was experimentally proven by dr edward jenner in 1796
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_17.wav,274226,during his time in the 18th century many people died due to smallpox a dreadful disease
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_18.wav,318528,he noticed that milkmaids and dairy workers who were often affected by cowpox disease were not affected by smallpox
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_19.wav,329396,cowpox was a disease resembling smallpox but with less intensity of symptoms it was contracted from the cows
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_20.wav,488220,keeping this in mind dr jenner collected a puslike material from a blister on the hand of a milkmaid caused by cowpox and injected it into an eightyearold boy named james phipps
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_21.wav,244968,after six weeks phipps was inoculated with the smallpox virus by dr jenner
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_22.wav,276732,to his surprise phipps was not affected by the smallpox virus and he did not contract smallpox
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_23.wav,462306,dr jenner confirmed that the cowpox virus stimulated the immune system in phippss body and produced antibodies and memory cells to clear the cowpox virus from the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_24.wav,328560,when the smallpox virus entered the body the retained memory cells produced antibodies and cleared the viruses from the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_25.wav,407136,dr jenner concluded that the cowpox material can be injected as a vaccine into the body of healthy people so that they would not contract smallpox
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_26.wav,372864,he thus coined the term vaccine which comes from the latin word vacca meaning cow and vaccinia meaning cowpox
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_27.wav,354474,the process of vaccination is otherwise called prophylaxis and the substance that is used for vaccination is called vaccine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_28.wav,448932,vaccine when administered to an individual triggers the production of antibodies and lymphocytes in the body to kill the pathogens a phenomenon called immunisation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_29.wav,334412,today vaccines are administered to almost all the children in the country through the vaccination programme initiated by the government
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_30.wav,542556,as part of the vaccination programme doctors advise all mothers to get their newborn babies vaccinated according to the vaccination schedule presented in the form of a table in the vaccination chart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_32.wav,575992,under the vaccination programme vaccines against diseases like polio hepatitis diphtheria pertussis tetanus measles mumps and rubella are administered
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_33.wav,358652,apart from these certain vaccines which are exceptional include smallpox rabies chickenpox etc
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_34.wav,573484,further the vaccines that are currently available are of different types namely killed inactivated vaccines attenuated live vaccines toxoids and mild strain live vaccines
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_35.wav,337756,thus vaccination helps in developing resistance against diseases caused by microorganisms in the body of an individual
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_3.wav,264194,have you observed that only some individuals are affected by fever or common cold during change in the seasons
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_4.wav,208188,have you wondered why only some individuals are affected why not others
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_5.wav,281748,generally when our body is exposed to diseasecausing microbes it exhibits a defence mechanism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_6.wav,328560,this defence offered by the immune system in the body is called natural protection or active immunity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_7.wav,364504,if the resistance offered by the immune system is greater than the strength of the microbes individuals are not affected by the disease
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_8.wav,270046,however those individuals with less resistance are affected by the diseasecausing microbes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/common_diseases_vaccination_9.wav,305990,invariably in all the individuals active immunity can be stimulated by some external protection methods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/deforestation_10.wav,290108,with the advent of railways wood was needed as fuel to run locomotives and also to lay sleepers under railway lines

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/desireesbaby_92.wav,317064,we will now look at each element of the story individually remember that not all stories will have each of the elements  
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/desireesbaby_93.wav,702422,first we will look at the setting there are two aspects to consider under setting the location of the story and the time and date when the story takes place the story is set in louisiana united states of america the time period is mid nineteenth century during the era of slavery
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/desireesbaby_95.wav,932298,stories must have at least one character most stories usually have a protagonist and an antagonist the protagonist is the main character of the story whereas antagonist is the person opposing the protagonist the antagonist is usually a negative character a story might not have an antagonist then there are the secondary characters
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/desireesbaby_97.wav,902206,next we will look at the plot plot is the structure of a story it refers to the events that make up the story the initial event is the exposition or the way the story is introduced to the reader soon after the exposition the central problem of the story is presented this is the conflict in the plot an event that takes the plot of the story forward
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/desireesbaby_99.wav,959884,point of view refers to the way the story is narrated broadly speaking there are three types of points of views the first person point of view is when the story is narrated by a character from the story it can be easily identified by the use of the pronouns i me and myself usually its the protagonist of the story who narrates the story but secondary characters might also be the narrator
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/desireesbaby_9.wav,378920,kates major works were two short story collections named bayou folk 1894 and a night in acadie 1897
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_10.wav,275062,to begin with diffusion can occur in all types of media such as liquids and gases
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_11.wav,908688,for instance diffusion of liquid in liquid medium occurs when ink is dropped into water diffusion of solid in liquid medium is seen in the case of sugar cube and water diffusion of liquid in gas medium is seen when perfume is sprayed in the air and diffusion of solid in gas medium is seen when dust particles disperse in air
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_12.wav,265030,on the other hand as seen with the dialysis tubing osmosis occurs only in a liquid medium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_13.wav,479862,diffusion involves the direct movement of molecules across different media without the requirement of any membrane while osmosis occurs only through a semipermeable membrane
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_14.wav,289272,with respect to the pace of the processes diffusion is rapid in gases and slow in the case of liquids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_15.wav,173080,while osmosis in general is a very slow process
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_16.wav,514970,as far as energy is concerned diffusion does not involve any energy expenditure while osmosis requires energy to push the solvent molecules across the semipermeable membrane
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_17.wav,468994,lastly in terms of the distance travelled by the molecules it is observed that in diffusion gas liquid or solid molecules diffuse over long distances
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_18.wav,283420,on the other hand the molecules moving through osmosis are transported only up to a short distance
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_19.wav,231594,thus we have looked into the differences between the processes of diffusion and osmosis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_2.wav,248312,in this module you will learn about the differences between diffusion and osmosis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_3.wav,352802,what happens if you add a pinch of food colour into a beaker containing water the food colour spreads through water and imparts its colour to the water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_4.wav,574320,now take a dialysis tubing seal it at one end fill it with water and add food colour to the water then seal the other end of the dialysis tube also and drop it into a beaker containing water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_5.wav,163884,you will observe that the dialysis tubing bulges in size
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_6.wav,389582,so what do these two activities indicate both of them involve the movement of some molecules but what is the difference between the two phenomena
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_7.wav,579336,in the first case there is movement of solute molecules that is food colour from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration this process is called diffusion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_8.wav,883610,in the second case there is movement of solvent molecules that is water from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration of solvent or from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration of solute through a semipermeable membrane this process is called osmosis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/diffusion_osmosis_9.wav,758222,now let us further see how both diffusion and osmosis vary from each other in terms of the media they occur in the role of the semipermeable membrane if any the pace of the process requirement of energy and the distance travelled by the molecules
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_10.wav,285928,towards the anterior end the first segment bears the mouth which opens into the buccal cavity up to the third segment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_11.wav,270046,the buccal cavity is followed by a muscular pharynx which continues into a narrow oesophagus between the fifth and seventh segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_12.wav,246640,the gizzard located in the eighth and ninth segments helps grind soil particles and organic matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_13.wav,234102,this organic matter is mixed with soil and is digested in the stomach that lies between the ninth and fourteenth segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_14.wav,262522,the stomach also has calciferous glands which neutralise the humic acid present in the partially decomposed organic matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_15.wav,228250,the stomach continues into a long intestine which starts from the fifteenth segment and continues till the last segment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_16.wav,227414,a pair of short conical projections of intestinal caecae is present on the twenty sixth segment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_17.wav,409644,the intestine shows internal folds called typhlosole between the twenty sixth and the thirty fifth segments which also increases the surface area for better absorption of digested nutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_18.wav,285092,finally in the last segment the alimentary canal opens to the exterior through a small aperture called the anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_19.wav,500760,as the ingested matter passes through the alimentary canal it is broken down into simpler absorbable molecules by digestive enzymes these molecules are then absorbed through intestinal membranes and are utilised by the earthworm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_21.wav,168900,this system consists of blood vessels capillaries and hearts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_22.wav,182274,small blood vessels supply blood to the gut nerve cord and body wall
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_23.wav,302646,earthworms also have blood glands between the fourth and sixth segments that produce blood cells and haemoglobin which are dissolved in the blood plasma
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_25.wav,249148,moreover the hearts which are important organs in the circulatory system help circulate blood in one direction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_28.wav,221562,there are three types of nephridia namely septal integumentary and pharyngeal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_29.wav,311842,the septal nephridia are present on either side of the intersegmental septa between the fifteenth segment and the last segment and open into the intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_30.wav,289272,the integumentary nephridia are attached to the lining of the body wall from the third segment to the last segment and open on to the body surface
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_31.wav,261686,the pharyngeal nephridia occur as paired tufts on either side of the pharynx and oesophagus from the fourth to the sixth segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_32.wav,231594,all three types of nephridia have similar structures and regulate the volume and composition of body fluids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_33.wav,448096,each nephridium has a funnel that collects excess coelomic fluid this funnel links to a tubular part of the nephridium from where waste is discharged through nephridiopores
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_36.wav,370356,at the anterior end in the third and fourth segments the nerve cord bifurcates encircles the pharynx and joins the cerebral ganglia to form a nerve ring
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_37.wav,304318,the cerebral ganglia along with other nerves in the ring integrate sensory input as well as control the muscular responses of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_38.wav,390418,did you know that earthworms dont possess eyes however they have light and touch sensitive receptors to help them recognise light intensities and ground vibrations
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_39.wav,380386,besides they also have specialised chemoreceptors or taste receptors which help them respond to any chemical stimuli and are situated at the anterior end
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_3.wav,193978,our planet is home to thousands of animals that exhibit morphological similarities and differences
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_41.wav,285092,earthworm is hermaphrodite which means that both male and female reproductive systems are present in the same individual
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_42.wav,346114,the male reproductive system consists of two pairs of testes in the tenth and eleventh segments with their vasa deferentia running up to the eighteenth segment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_43.wav,266702,here the vasa deferentia and the duct of the prostate gland join to form a common prostrate and spermatic duct
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_45.wav,200664,in the seventeenth and nineteenth segments a pair of accessory glands is found in each segment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_46.wav,352802,also each segment from the sixth to the ninth bears a pair of spermatheca which receives and stores spermatozoa during copulation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_47.wav,281748,the female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries present on the inter segmental septum of the twelfth and thirteenth segments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_48.wav,358652,below the ovaries are the ovarian funnels which continue into the oviduct and join to form a single female genital pore on the fourteenth segment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_49.wav,169736,although earthworms are hermaphrodites each worm mates with another worm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_4.wav,369520,similarly they also exhibit certain anatomical similarities and differences anatomy refers to the study of the internal structures or organs of an organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_50.wav,291780,while mating two worms lie in a juxtaposed position resulting in a mutual exchange of sperm between the two worms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_51.wav,302646,later cocoons containing mature sperm eggs and a nutritive fluid are secreted by the gland cells of the clitellum
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_52.wav,174750,the eggs are fertilised by the sperm in the cocoons and are deposited in the soil
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_53.wav,508282,inside the cocoons embryos develop and after three weeks each cocoon produces about two to twenty baby worms these baby worms show direct development which means the larval stage is absent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_54.wav,377880,we have just studied the anatomical features of the earthworm such as the body wall structure alimentary canal and circulatory nervous and reproductive systems
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_5.wav,440572,lets take a look at the anatomical features of an earthworm such as the body wall the alimentary canal and the circulatory excretory nervous and reproductive systems
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_6.wav,356982,the cross section of an earthworm shows that the body wall is covered by a thin layer of cuticle followed by a single layer of epidermis which contains secretory gland cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_7.wav,328560,below the epidermis lie two layers of muscles circular and longitudinal muscles followed by the innermost coelomic epithelium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_8.wav,194812,now lets take a look at the longitudinal section of the worm to study its remaining anatomical features
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/earthworm_9.wav,242460,you will notice a straight tube that runs from the first to the last segment of the body this tube is the alimentary canal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_10.wav,264398,similarly the regulator of fan b is connected in series with fan b
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_11.wav,276102,besides fans a and b are both connected in parallel with the source of power supply
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_12.wav,307030,so keeping this example in mind let us now learn about series and parallel connections of electric resistors
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_13.wav,190838,in series connection of two resistors they are connected one after the other
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_14.wav,251860,such that one terminal of the power supply is connected to one end of the first resistor
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_15.wav,230962,the other end of the first resistor is connected to one end of the second resistor
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_16.wav,307866,finally the free end of the second resistor is connected to the second terminal of the source of power supply
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_17.wav,206720,similarly more than two resistors can be connected in series
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_18.wav,439106,when resistors are connected in series the amount of current passing through all the resistors is the same this is because there is only one possible path for the current
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_19.wav,637218,so lets say if n number of resistors of resistances r one r two upto r n are connected in series then the total resistance or equivalent resistance of the circuit r s is equal to the sum of the individual resistances
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_20.wav,500964,it can be expressed mathematically as r s is equal to r one plus r two plus r three plus and so on plus r n
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_21.wav,408176,thus we can say that the equivalent resistance in the circuit in which resistors are connected in series is more than the resistance of any individual resistor
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_22.wav,305358,therefore resistors are connected in series when it is required to increase the resistance in the circuit
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_23.wav,271922,as a result the current in the circuit decreases due to the increase in the resistance
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_24.wav,186658,this is what happens in the case of the regulator of a fan
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_29.wav,305358,to connect two resistors in parallel the first terminals of both the resistors are connected to a common point
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_2.wav,266904,in this module you will learn about combination of resistors in series and parallel
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_30.wav,260218,in the same way the second terminals of both the resistors are connected to another common point
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_31.wav,204212,then both the common points are connected to the source of power supply
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_32.wav,431582,in this type of connection the potential difference across all resistors remains the same because all are connected to the same terminals of the source of power supply individually
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_33.wav,374740,however the current splits into different paths and as a result the total current in the circuit is split into two components
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_34.wav,675670,so lets say if n number of resistors of resistance r one r two upto r n are connected in parallel then the reciprocal of the net resistance or equivalent resistance of the circuit is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_35.wav,661460,it can be expressed mathematically as one upon the net resistance that is r p is equal to one upon r one plus one upon r two plus one upon r three plus and so on plus one upon r n
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_36.wav,281116,therefore the equivalent resistance in the circuit in which the resistors are connected in parallel
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_38.wav,286968,thus whenever the resistance is to be decreased parallel connection of resistors is used
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_39.wav,278608,it is also used when all the components in a circuit require the same amount of potential difference for operation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_3.wav,454150,let us consider a fan with a regulator you must have observed that when we adjust the regulator to a lower number the speed of rotation of the fan decreases
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_40.wav,398146,for example all household electrical appliances such as fans lights and refrigerators require two hundred and twenty volts to operate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_41.wav,253532,in order to supply the same voltage to all the electrical appliances they are connected in parallel
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_42.wav,428238,as we saw earlier fans a and b are connected in parallel to the source of power supply hence both of them are independent of each other
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_43.wav,434090,what will happen if the fans are connected in series if the fans are connected in series the total resistance in the circuit will increase and both the fans will rotate slowly
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_44.wav,351334,moreover when connected in series if one fan malfunctions then the other one will also stop working
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_46.wav,291984,as far as resistance of the resistors is concerned we need a specific resistance for a complex circuit to work
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_47.wav,400652,but due to a large number of possibilities and different nature of demands it is not feasible to manufacture resistors with all possible resistances
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_48.wav,230962,therefore resistors are manufactured with some specific values only
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_49.wav,331272,resistors are used to obtain a required resistance by combining them in series or parallel or combination of series and parallel
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_50.wav,336288,let us now calculate the net resistance of a circuit consisting of a combination of resistors connected to series and parallel circuits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_51.wav,481736,consider a circuit with two resistors of resistances five ohm and seven ohm connected in series along with three resistors of resistances nine ohm each connected in parallel
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_52.wav,338794,to calculate the net resistance we must first calculate the total resistance of the resistors connected in parallel
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_53.wav,458332,thus the total resistance of the resistors connected in parallel is one upon r p which is equal to one upon nine plus one upon nine plus one upon nine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_54.wav,478394,from this we get one upon r p is equal to three upon nine which is equal to one upon three therefore r p is equal to three
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_55.wav,441612,after deriving this value we can now consider that there are three resistors of resistance five ohm seven ohm and three ohm respectively connected in series
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_56.wav,460840,therefore the total resistance of the circuit is r s equal to five ohm plus seven ohm plus three ohm which is equal to fifteen ohm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_57.wav,44,thus we have learnt about resistors in series and in parallel and the method to calculate the total resistance in a combined circuit
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_5.wav,205046,now consider another fan b with its own regulator
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_6.wav,333736,if we adjust the regulator of fan a it changes the speed of fan a without even affecting the speed of fan b
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_7.wav,351290,similarly the regulator of fan b changes the speed of fan b only without affecting the speed of fan a
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/electricity_9.wav,278564,this is because the regulator of fan a is connected in series with that of fan a
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_10.wav,549406,furthermore though energy is not destructible it is not possible to transfer hundred per cent of the energy into the desired form without suffering any loss during the process of transformation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_11.wav,417332,so in the case of screw jack when some energy is supplied to it the entire energy is not converted for the purpose of useful work
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_12.wav,266030,here a part of the energy supplied to the screw jack is used to overcome friction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_13.wav,308662,the energy used to overcome friction is converted into heat energy which is not a useful form of energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_14.wav,383894,however the total energy that is the sum of the utilised and unutilised energy is equal to the amount of energy supplied
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_15.wav,402284,this is in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics which prohibits hundred per cent transfer of energy into the desired form of energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_16.wav,552750,according to the second law of thermodynamics when energy is put to work a part of it is always converted into an unused form of energy such as heat mainly due to friction and radiation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_17.wav,287764,to understand the second law of thermodynamics let us consider an example of food chain in the ecosystem
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_19.wav,251820,this energy is transformed from the green plants to decomposers in different steps
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_20.wav,293616,in the energy transformation path a certain amount of energy is lost into space in the form of heat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_21.wav,449096,the average energy produced by a plant or producer is  twenty thousand eight hundred ten calories which is trapped from solar energy during photosynthesis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_22.wav,445752,out of the total of twenty thousand eight hundred ten calories eleven thousand nine hundred seventy seven calories are consumed by the plant during its respiratory process
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_23.wav,261014,the remaining  eight thousand eight hundred thirty three calories are stored in the plant as food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_24.wav,391418,the primary consumer receives only three thousand three hundred and sixty eight calories from the eight thousand eight hundred thirty three calories in the plant
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_25.wav,445752,the remaining five thousand four hundred sixty five calories is transformed into some other form of energy such as heat sound etc during the process of consumption
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_26.wav,300302,the primary consumer in turn spends one thousand eight hundred ninety calories for its own respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_27.wav,509282,continuing with the food chain of the remaining one thousand four hundred seventy eight calories of energy the primary consumer passes only three hundred eighty three calories to the secondary consumer
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_28.wav,382222,the remaining one thousand ninety five calories are transformed into some other form of  energy such as heat radiation and sound
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_29.wav,191634,this process continues as we move up higher in the food chain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_2.wav,255162,in this module you will learn about the first and second laws of thermodynamics
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_30.wav,265194,in each case the total sum of the useful and non useful energy remains constant
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_31.wav,557766,the energy used in respiration and in decay or degradation of organic matter appears to be non useful heat energy because this energy does not reach the consumer in the next stage of the food chain
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_32.wav,694020,therefore just like in the case of machines even in the ecosystem energy transfer is not hundred per cent efficient a portion of the transferred energy always gets converted into a non useful form in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_33.wav,226742,thus we have looked into the first and second laws of thermodynamics
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_3.wav,321198,have you ever seen a car being lifted using a screw jack does the screw jack generate energy on its own to lift the car
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_4.wav,537702,no the screw jack cannot generate energy on its own some external energy such as mechanical energy or electrical energy is required to be provided to the screw jack for lifting the car
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_5.wav,341260,while lifting the car the external energy supplied to the screw jack is converted into gravitational potential energy of the car
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_6.wav,128938,this is in accordance with the law of conservation of energy which is also known as the first law of thermodynamics
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_7.wav,416494,the first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be transformed from one form to another form but it can neither be created nor destroyed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_8.wav,371354,if a certain amount of energy of one type is dissipated then this energy is converted into an equal amount of energy of another type
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/energy_flow_9.wav,369682,also the first law of thermodynamics prohibits from creating any tool or machine that can generate energy on its own
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_10.wav,245804,lets look at the geological time scale to understand which different events occurred at what time in the history of the earth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_11.wav,815900,the geologic time scale is divided into two eons precambrian and phanerozoic the precambrian eon is divided into the hadean archean and proterozoic eras while the phanerozoic eon is divided into the palaeozoic mesozoic and cenozoic eras
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_13.wav,714754,the palaeozoic era spans from around five hundred forty or five hundred seventy million years ago to about two hundred forty eight million years ago it is divided into six periods which are the cambrian ordovician silurian devonian carboniferous and permian
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_14.wav,420510,in the cambrian period plant life consisted of primitive algae and seaweeds while animal life consisted of invertebrates such as sponges starfish and sea urchins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_15.wav,259178,in the ordovician and silurian periods true plants with a stem leaves and roots developed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_16.wav,290108,at the same time there was an increase in the population of animals such as sea lilies molluscs and sea scorpions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_17.wav,524164,the ordovician period also marked the evolution of the first vertebrate the jawless fish around three hundred fifty million years ago for example cephalaspis and hemicyclaspis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_18.wav,219890,next came the devonian period in which plants grew in profusion and covered a large part of the land
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_19.wav,183946,this period also witnessed a rapid evolution of fish such as sharks and rays
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_20.wav,548406,about three hundred million years ago in the carboniferous period pteridophytes such as ferns and horse tails dominated the earth they were the first trees that thrived in vast swamps that stretched across length and breadth of the planet
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_21.wav,187290,over the years these pteridophytes fell down and formed coal deposits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_22.wav,722278,meanwhile in the carboniferous period around three hundred and fifty million years ago there were also fish with stout and strong fins who could move equally well on land as well as in water these were called lung fish for example neoceratodus and protopterus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_23.wav,526672,another important fish of this period were the lobe fin fish which later evolved as amphibians coelacanth is a lobe fin fish which was thought to be extinct earlier but is now considered a living fossil
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_24.wav,326888,in times of water shortage lobe fin fish probably made their way onto land and might have added insects and other arthropods to their diet
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_25.wav,168064,modern day descendents of lobe fin fish are frogs and salamanders
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_26.wav,277568,the last period of the paleozoic era was the permian period in which amphibians evolved into reptiles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_27.wav,604412,they laid eggs with harder shells that were able to sustain their own water and did not get dehydrated in the absence of water thus reptiles became the first animals to successfully lay eggs on land and are known to be first terrestrial animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_28.wav,705560,in fact for reptiles water was no longer a source of life but a food source that provided hydration as well over millions of years reptiles evolved into different orders each of these orders developed different characteristics which helped them survive in various environments
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_29.wav,895312,today there are four orders of class reptilia the first order is chelonia which includes turtles and tortoise the second order rhyncocephalia includes tuatara the third order squamata includes lizards and snakes while the fourth order crocodilian includes crocodiles and alligators
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_30.wav,184782,meanwhile the plants that existed during the permian age were ferns
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_31.wav,624476,let us now take a look at the mesozoic era which extends from two hundred forty five or two hundred forty eight million years ago to sixty five million years ago this era includes the triassic jurassic and cretaceous periods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_32.wav,437230,in the mesozoic era around two hundred million years ago some land reptiles went into the water and evolved as fish like reptiles for example ichthyosaurus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_33.wav,575992,meanwhile the land reptiles of the mesozoic era were the famous dinosaurs with terrifying large teeth they were a diverse group of reptiles which remained the most important terrestrial vertebrates for more than one hundred and sixty million years
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_34.wav,215710,the tallest dinosaur known as tyrannosaurus rex was around twenty feet tall
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_36.wav,613608,dinosaurs suddenly disappeared sixty five million years ago they probably became extinct because they failed to cope with climactic changes or they may have evolved into birds however the precise reason for their extinction still remains unknown
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_37.wav,583516,it is estimated that birds have descended from reptilian ancestors such as ornithischian dinosaurs during the jurassic period of the mesozoic era in fact birds became modernised in the cretaceous period of the mesozoic era
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_38.wav,392926,the flora in the mesozoic era was dominated by flowering plants and non flowering plants such as ferns pines conifers and cycads
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_39.wav,451440,let us now take a look at the cenozoic era which began sixty five million years ago and continues till today this era includes the tertiary and quaternary periods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_3.wav,204008,the study of evolution is not complete without considering how the first form of life came into being
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_40.wav,316858,in the cenozoic era plants such as bryophytes and angiosperms flourished and continued to spread and diversify on earth
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_41.wav,448096,this era is also known as the age of mammals which are highly evolved vertebrates they have a backbone which encloses a network of nerves which leads to a brain contained in a skull
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_43.wav,418004,mammals are characterised by viviparity ie they give birth to young ones have mammary glands and the unborn young are protected inside the mothers body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_44.wav,349458,the evolution of mammals was a slow process that spanned across seventy million years mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding danger
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_45.wav,295124,in south america there were mammals resembling the present day horse hippopotamus bear and rabbit
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_46.wav,328560,due to continental drift in ancient times land masses broke apart and consequently the landmass of south america joined north america
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_47.wav,206516,as a result south american mammals were overridden by north american mammals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_48.wav,169736,continental drift also caused the safe development of the australian marsupials
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_49.wav,325216,meanwhile there were mammals which evolved in water such as whales dolphins seals and sea cows
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_4.wav,343606,the unicellular organism cyanobacteria or blue green algae was the first form of life on earth around two thousand million years ago
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_50.wav,321036,however the most successful evolution story was that of human beings as they developed language skills and self consciousness as well
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_5.wav,334412,however we still dont know how the organic molecules which are the main building blocks of life evolved into unicellular organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_6.wav,354474,probably some of these cells for example cyanobacteria could oxygenate the atmosphere thereby making way for other life forms to evolve
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_7.wav,224070,the reaction for the release of oxygen might have been similar to the light reaction during photosynthesis in plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_8.wav,555094,during photosynthesis the suns energy helps to split water resulting in the release of electrons that are channelised further by light harvesting pigments this reaction ends in the formation of carbohydrates and the release of oxygen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/evolution_9.wav,215710,gradually protistis developed and slowly evolved into multi cellular life forms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_0.wav,204008,in this module you will learn about the factors that led to socialism in europe
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_10.wav,618624,it saw the replacement of manual labour with machines resulting in goods being manufactured at a much faster rate the industrial revolution saw the formation of new cities development of industrial regions and the expansion of the railways
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_11.wav,281748,as a result more people went to work in factories however the working conditions were quite pitiable
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_12.wav,183110,long work hours coupled with low wages demoralized the workers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_13.wav,293452,sometimes the low demand for goods resulted in unemployment too all this left the workers yearning for change
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_14.wav,212368,the solution was to stop the feudal system of privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_15.wav,433886,liberals and radicals rallied around the right of individual freedom the right of the poor to work and the right of people having money to operate without restraint
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_16.wav,453112,revolutionaries across europe be it france italy germany or russia all dreamt about change and worked to overthrow the existing monarchies
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_17.wav,364504,as you will see in the modules to come the russian revolution too succeeded in enforcing change the price to pay for it was however quite heavy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_1.wav,401284,the russian revolution changed life forever having replaced the rule by the monarchy the dawn of socialism promised peace and equality to all
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_2.wav,482368,over the next few modules you will hear the story of the russian revolution the story of how people decided to get rid of privilege and class division and create a society made up of equals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_3.wav,268374,before we learn about the revolution itself it is important for us to understand how socialism came to europe
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_4.wav,409644,the french revolution during the late eighteenth century was an important stepping stone for socialism as it propagated the ideas of freedom and equality
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_5.wav,402120,it also gave hope to people by showing them that it was possible to create a society where people could decide who controlled the economic and social power
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_7.wav,620296,even in india eminent people like raja rammohan roy and derozio discussed the importance of the french revolution however people across the world were divided on the degree of change that needed to be made to society
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_8.wav,528344,on a broad scale these people could be divided into three distinct groups liberals radicals and conservatives liberals dreamt of a nation where all religions could be considered equal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/factors_socialism_europe_9.wav,194812,the industrial revolution had started in britain and it slowly spread across europe

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/firstday_1.wav,539368,we say goodbye to each other before we go home going to school is so much fun
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_10.wav,410480,therefore it is important to eat a balanced diet a balanced diet provides the right amount of nutrients and energy required by our body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_12.wav,246640,energy value is associated with the energy produced by a unit quantity of food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_13.wav,271718,the energy produced by a unit quantity of food is measured in calories or joules
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_14.wav,420510,a calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree celsius and is represented as cal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_15.wav,265030,thousand calories make up one kilocalorie and is represented as k cal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_16.wav,393762,with reference to the macronutrients one gram of fat on oxidation produces nine calories or thirtyseven joules of energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_17.wav,332740,similarly one gram of carbohydrate on oxidation produces four calories or seventeen joules of energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_18.wav,308498,likewise one gram of protein on oxidation produces four calories or seventeen joules of energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_19.wav,446424,on comparing the energy values or calorific values we can see that the energy value of fats is more than double the value of carbohydrates and proteins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_20.wav,232430,now let us understand how the food we consume produces energy in our body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_21.wav,518314,when common sugar is burnt in air it releases energy in the form of heat and light here this rapid process of oxidation of common sugar in the environment is called combustion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_22.wav,626982,the same process occurs inside our body too where the common sugar is substituted by glucose however in our body the breakdown of glucose or sugar occurs in multiple steps and not in a single step as in burning
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_23.wav,256670,this process of oxidation of food to release energy in the body is called respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_24.wav,253328,in both the processes namely combustion and respiration energy is produced
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_25.wav,379550,now since we are clear about the terms nutrient value and energy value let us correlate them by observing the same in different food items
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_26.wav,673794,let us now look at the composition of a few food items rich in macronutrients macronutrients include carbohydrates fats and proteins which are required by the body in large amounts and hence are consumed in grams as per the measuring quantity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_27.wav,241624,let us observe the nutrient and energy values of a few carbohydrate rich food items
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_28.wav,400448,the nutrient value of carbohydrates is more in rice bread and potato hence they are termed as carbohydrate rich food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_29.wav,209860,now observe the nutrient and energy values of some proteinrich food items
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_2.wav,228250,in this module you will learn about nutrient values in different food items
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_30.wav,337756,the nutrient value of proteins is more in egg meat and milk hence these food items are called protein rich food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_31.wav,244132,now take a look at the nutrient and energy values of some food items that are rich in fat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_32.wav,355310,the nutrient value of fats is more in ghee groundnuts and cheese hence these food items are called fat rich food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_33.wav,552586,comparing the nutrient and energy values of the food items given in the tables we can conclude that food rich in fat has a higher calorific or energy value than food rich in carbohydrates and proteins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_34.wav,682990,let us now look at the composition of a few food items rich in micronutrients micronutrients which include vitamins and minerals are required in less quantities by the body hence these are consumed in milligrams as per the requirement of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_35.wav,314350,consider soya beans apart from having macronutrients it is a rich source of vitamins and minerals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_36.wav,367848,these vitamins and minerals in soya beans provide energy values based on their nutrient values taken in milligrams or micrograms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_38.wav,341098,vitamins and minerals in papaya also provide energy values based on their nutrient values taken in milligrams or micrograms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_39.wav,305154,thus we have learnt about the calorific values or energy values of different food items or nutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_4.wav,231594,nutrients are of two types macronutrients and micronutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_5.wav,309334,macronutrients include carbohydrates fats and proteins these are organic nutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_6.wav,422182,whereas micronutrients include vitamins and minerals vitamins are organic nutrients while minerals are inorganic nutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_7.wav,204008,did you know that the nutrients present in food determine its nutrient value
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/food_health_diseases_8.wav,482368,nutrient value of a food item depends on the quantity of nutrients present in it amount of energy the nutrients can produce and the amount of absorbable nutrients present in it
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_0.wav,348622,in this module you will learn about the similarities between the development in the forest services and forest laws of india and java
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_10.wav,764910,in java the initiative to stand up against the dutch was taken by surontiko samin of randublatung a teak forest village he argued that the dutch had not created water wood and air and that they had no right to place restrictions on the natural forest resources that mother earth has given
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_11.wav,403792,forest services and scientific forestry was also introduced by the colonisers in both java and india to manage forests for shipbuilding and railways
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_12.wav,449768,the dutch in java practised a system known as the blandongdiensten system under which just like the british in india they imposed heavy rents on land under cultivation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_13.wav,252492,both the dutch in java and the british in india exploited the forest resources to meet their war needs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_14.wav,255000,during the first world war and the second world war the british cut many trees in india to meet their war needs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_15.wav,468994,java faced a similar fate at the hands of the dutch just before the japanese occupation of java the japanese further exploited the forests of java and left the forests in an irretrievable state
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_16.wav,362832,the impacts of war took its toll on the forests of java and india the forests that were lost could never be restored to their original state
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_17.wav,514134,the forests of java were transformed by the dutch the javanese people may never have thought that somewhere in another part of the world the indians also met a similar fate at the hands of their colonisers the british
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_18.wav,929586,since the 1980s the governments of different countries in asia and africa have learned from each others pasts and are trying to find new ways for better forest management they have learned a mutually beneficial system of forest management by allowing the forests to be managed by local forest dwellers whereby both the forest dwellers and the forest department are benefited through conservation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_1.wav,458128,what would you say if i told you that when people in the us celebrate thanksgiving day they are actually celebrating a counterpart of baisakhi celebrated in india and vice versa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_2.wav,332740,even though the two festivals are celebrated by the people of two different countries with different customs and rituals they are similar to a great extent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_3.wav,378716,both baisakhi and thanksgiving are celebrated to express joy over the harvest season and to express gratitude and thanks to god for it
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_4.wav,434722,just as these two festivals of different countries are similar the development and transformations of the forests of india and java in indonesia are similar to a great extent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_5.wav,280912,forest management in java and india was started by colonisers the dutch in java and the british in india
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_6.wav,211532,both carried out large scale deforestation for timber to build ships and sleepers for railways
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_7.wav,214040,shifting cultivation was practised for several generations by the forest communities of both places
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_8.wav,238280,remember the rebellion in bastar in 1910 and the important role of gunda dhur in the rebellion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/forest_transformation_9.wav,418004,the kalangs who were the wood cutting community of java also rebelled against the dutch in 1770 to stand up against the laws that restricted their access to the forests
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_0.wav,210696,in this module you will learn about france becoming a constitutional monarchy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_1.wav,470666,man is born free yet everywhere he is in chains now said jean jacques rousseau today we all take liberty and freedom of expression for granted
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_2.wav,335248,this was not the case in 18 th century france where the people had to fight for freedom from the years of oppression under the feudal lords
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_3.wav,341098,so the recognition of the national assembly by king louis and him agreeing to their demands was a victory for the entire third estate
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_4.wav,722278,with the abolition of special privileges tithes and feudal taxes people were happier as a huge burden had been lifted off them the next thing on the agenda of the national assembly was the creation of a constitution they completed this in 1791
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_5a.wav,443916,as per the new constitution france became a constitutional monarchy with the king or the executive having to share power with the legislature and the judiciary
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_6.wav,364504,not everyone could vote as per the new constitution only men who were older than 25 years and who paid taxes were allowed to vote
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_7.wav,708066,this did not go well with people like jean paul marat who criticized it vehemently in his paper stating that the government was represented only by the rich marats writings were so fierce that he was made a member of the national assembly so as to calm him
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8a.wav,159704,the constitution commenced with the declaration of the rights of man
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8b.wav,417168,it stated that the right to life to freedom of speech to freedom of opinion and to equality before the law were intrinsic to all human beings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8c.wav,301810,but remember that majority of the people of france at that period were uneducated and could not read or write
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8d.wav,236608,visual symbols were used to share the message to them the broken chains stood for freedom
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8e.wav,178094,the blue white and red symbolized the national colours of france
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8f.wav,244968,the red phrygian cap was a sign of freedom and was worn by slaves when they became free
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_8l.wav,419676,the tablet also known as the law tablet signified equality using these political symbols the important ideas were communicated to the masses
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_monarchy_9.wav,471502,with the creation of the constitution and the declaration of mankind king louis powers reduced drastically however as you will see later on he had plans of his own
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_0.wav,410480,in this module you will learn about french society in the early 18 th century and the circumstances that led to the french revolution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_10.wav,609428,the national assembly stripped king louis of all his powers and imprisoned him and his family on september 21 1792 a new assembly called the convention was formed and france was declared a republic
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_11.wav,412988,now that king louis was imprisoned and that france was in the hands of the people one would have expected that things would only get better actually it got worse
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_12.wav,341098,the year immediately following the formation of the french republic is actually referred to as the reign of terror hundreds died during this period
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_13.wav,250820,and they were all killed using the dreaded guillotine a machine that was used for beheading people
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_14.wav,390418,the national committee now called the convention and headed by robespierre felt that the best way to start the new republic was to execute the king
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_15.wav,305154,so they put king louis on trial and found him guilty he was allowed to spend his last moments with his family
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_16.wav,437230,on january 21 1793 king louis was beheaded his charge being the conspiracy against public liberty and the general safety
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_17.wav,266702,marie antoinette was also guillotined on october 16 th of the same year the monarchy was no more
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_1.wav,287600,the people of france were happy the national assembly had succeeded in making france into a constitutional monarchy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_2.wav,370356,however having been stripped of almost all his powers king louis was not happy he decided to launch a campaign with the help of austria
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_3.wav,519986,as queen marie antoinette was from the austrian royal family louis was sure that if they were to reach austria they would be safe so louis and his family disguised themselves as peasants and headed off to austria
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_4.wav,426362,unfortunately the revolutionists came to know of the plan the king and queen were caught near the border of france before they could enter austria they were brought back to paris
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_5.wav,927078,the people of paris were enraged and now lost all faith in their royal family the national assembly decided to wage war on austria lots of volunteers came to fight from the neighbouring regions patriotic songs such as the marseillaise were sung marseilles was composed by roget de l isle and is now the national anthem of france
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_6.wav,452276,it was about during this time that maximilian robespierre came into the forefront of the revolution a lawyer by profession he was a strong orator and was the head of the jacobin club
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_7.wav,838470,the jacobins included members from the lesser prosperous middle class they considered themselves different jacobins were also called sansculottes which meant those without knee breeches they wore long striped trousers similar to dock workers and wore a red phrygian cap that symbolized liberty
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_8.wav,433050,meanwhile the war was still going on with austria prussia too entered the war as an ally to austria the expenses of the war raised the prices of food again
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/france_republic_9.wav,715590,high prices and shortage of food angered the parisians on august 10 1792 thousands of people stormed the palace of the tuileries where king louis and his family were staying all the kings guards were massacred and the king just barely managed to escape
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_10.wav,347786,as the food passes through the stomach it is partially digested by hydrogen chloride hcl and gastric juices secreted by the walls of the stomach
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_11.wav,384566,this partially digested food called chyme then passes into the duodenum which receives pancreatic juices and bile through a common bile duct
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_12.wav,263358,the pancreatic juices digest carbohydrates and proteins while the bile emulsifies fat present in the food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_13.wav,346950,the digestion of food is completed in the intestine where it is absorbed by numerous finger like projections called villi and microvilli
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_14.wav,210696,the undigested solid waste passes through the rectum and is finally egested through the cloaca
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_16.wav,208188,interestingly frogs respire in water and on land in two different ways
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_17.wav,364504,in water the frogs skin functions as the respiratory organ and the gaseous exchange takes place through diffusion this is called cutaneous respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_18.wav,214040,on land a frog respires through the buccal cavity skin and lungs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_19.wav,436394,during respiration air is drawn into the buccal cavity through the nostrils and is forced into the lungs this type of respiration through the lungs is called pulmonary respiration
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_20.wav,204844,did you know that during aestivation and hibernation frogs respire only through their skin
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_21.wav,170572,the vascular system also forms a part of the anatomical study and
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_23.wav,185618,the blood vascular system consists of the heart blood vessels and blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_24.wav,208188,while the lymphatic system consists of lymph lymph channels and lymph nodes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_25.wav,346114,the heart is situated in the upper part of the body cavity and consists of three chambers two atria and one ventricle and is covered by the pericardium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_26.wav,256670,the right atrium is connected to the sinus venosus which receives blood through the major veins called vena cava
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_27.wav,323544,the oxygenated blood is then pumped into the ventricle which opens into a sac like structure called the conus arteriosus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_28.wav,206516,after which it is distributed to different parts of the body by arteries or the arterial system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_29.wav,293452,deoxygenated blood from the different parts of the body is collected by veins or the venous system and is pumped into the heart
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_31.wav,174750,in the hepatic portal system veins are connected to the liver and the intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_32.wav,214876,while in the renal portal system veins are connected to the kidney and lower parts of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_33.wav,213204,the blood consists of plasma red blood cells white blood cells and platelets
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_35.wav,304318,as the heart beats blood circulates various substances such as gases nutrients and hormones to different parts of the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_37.wav,258342,this system consists of a pair of kidneys ureters the urinary bladder and cloaca
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_38.wav,214876,the kidneys are dark red bean shaped structures situated on either side of the vertebral column
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_3.wav,550914,frogs have well developed organ systems their digestive respiratory vascular excretory nervous and reproductive systems are held in a body cavity lets take a look at each system in detail
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_40.wav,560946,in male frogs the two ureters function as a urinogenital duct and open into the cloaca however in female frogs the ureters and the oviduct open separately into the cloaca
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_41.wav,221562,towards the ventral side of the rectum is a thin walled urinary bladder which also opens into the cloaca
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_42.wav,225742,the nephrons in the kidneys absorb the excretory wastes from the blood and convert them into urea
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_43.wav,182274,as frogs excrete urea they are called ureotelic animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_44.wav,171408,the endocrine glands and the nervous system are also a part of the anatomical study
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/frog_45.wav,305154,in frogs the chemical coordination of different organs is brought about by hormones that are secreted by the endocrine glands

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_28.wav,408136,the following are the achievements of chandrayaan mission it discovered the presence of water molecules on the surface of the moon albeit in extremely small quantities
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_29.wav,235936,the moon mineralogy mapper confirmed that the moon was once in a molten state
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_2.wav,187452,in this module you will learn about chandrayaan
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_30.wav,309498,the terrain mapping camera or tmc provided high resolution spectral data on the mineralogy of the moon
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_31.wav,510954,the tmc also acquired images of peaks and craters and confirmed that the moon consists mostly of craters it may be conducive for human habitation for extended manned missions in future
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_32.wav,376372,x ray signatures of metals such as aluminium magnesium and silicon were picked up by chandrayaans x ray spectrometer camera
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_33.wav,253492,more than forty thousand images were transmitted by chandrayaan camera in seventy five days
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_34.wav,376372,chandrayaan one proved and demonstrated the capabilities of indian scientists in planning and executing complex missions such as lunar probes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_35.wav,599562,thus we have looked into the details of chandrayaan one indias first lunar probe the data and images collected by chandrayaan are being analysed and is likely to pave the way for the first ever manned outpost in the moon in the future
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_3.wav,451602,until two thousand eight it was believed that the moon is a barren land devoid of any water there was also no evidence that it could be habitable for humans
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_4.wav,522654,however a probe launched on twenty second october two thousand eight by the indian space research organisation or isro from sriharikota in andhra pradesh changed this perception about the moon
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_5.wav,201662,chandrayaan one was indias first unmanned lunar probe
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_6.wav,384728,apart from the lunar orbiter it also carried the moon impact probe or mip it placed the indian flag on the moons soil
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_7.wav,429032,with this india joined the select group of three countries usa former soviet russia and japan to sent a probe to the surface of the moon
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_8.wav,208350,chandrayaan one was in operation until august two thousand nine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/gravitation_9.wav,573646,the cost of the project was only eighty million dollars that is about four hundred crore rupees this is only a fraction of the amount spent by nasa european space agency or the russian space agency for their projects
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_10.wav,390578,these vibrating energetic particles then collide with their neighbouring particles with greater energy and transfer a part of their energy to these particles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_11.wav,449092,in this manner more and more energy is transferred from the end at higher temperature to the end at lower temperature until the entire substance attains the same temperature
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_12.wav,457452,thus in the entire process of heat transfer through conduction the particles of the medium that is atoms or molecules vibrate about their mean positions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_13.wav,383054,but they do not move from their mean positions in other words there is no net displacement of particles during the process of conduction
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_14.wav,368844,conduction takes place only when the particles are very close to each other hence this phenomenon is observed only in solids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_15.wav,366336,now let us understand how heat is transferred in fluids that is liquids and gases with the help of an activity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_16.wav,271042,for this place a round bottomed flask filled more than half with water on a tripod
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_17.wav,308658,after that place a wide straw inside the round bottomed flask such that one end touches the bottom
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_18.wav,669774,then trap a few drops of ink through the open end of the straw without disturbing the set up so that only a small portion of water at the bottom of the round bottomed flask appears coloured after that gently remove the straw from the round bottomed flask
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_19.wav,306150,now place a spirit lamp under the round bottomed flask and then light it with a burning matchstick
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_20.wav,420670,you will observe the motion of coloured water as heat gets transferred from the hot region to the cold region this process of heat transfer is called convection
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_21.wav,332064,thus convection is a mode of transmission of heat energy due to the actual motion of particles of a medium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_22.wav,255996,now let us understand the process of convection based on the kinetic theory of matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_23.wav,434882,according to the kinetic theory of matter when a substance is heated the particles in the substance that is atoms or molecules come in direct contact with the source of heat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_24.wav,622128,as the particles absorb heat energy they undergo thermal expansion as a result their volume increases and they become lighter than the rest of the particles of the fluid and rise upwards taking the heat energy along with them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_25.wav,391414,since the light hot particles rise up the cold particles being heavier descend to take the empty place of the hot and light particles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_26.wav,308658,after a while the cold particles that have moved downwards also get heated and move upwards
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_27.wav,595378,this cycle of upward and downward movements of the hot and cold particles form currents in the medium these currents are known as convection currents due to convection current the whole fluid attains the same temperature
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_28.wav,286924,thus we have learnt the processes of conduction and convection based on the kinetic theory of matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_2.wav,279398,in this module you will learn about heat conduction and convection based on kinetic theory of matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_3.wav,491722,if you place one end of a metal spoon over a flame you will find that the other end of the spoon also becomes hot after a few minutes even though it is not in direct contact with the flame
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_4.wav,240946,from this we understand that there is a transfer of heat energy from one end to the other end
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_6.wav,536026,conduction is the process in which heat energy is transmitted from one particle to the other from a region of high temperature to one of low temperature without the actual movement of particles from their mean positions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_7.wav,283578,conduction can be explained based on the kinetic theory of matter that is also known as kinetic model of matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_8.wav,440730,according to the kinetic theory of matter if a solid such as a metal spoon is heated at one of its ends then the particles at this end absorb heat energy and
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/heat_cond_9.wav,330390,consequently their kinetic energy increases and they start vibrating with greater amplitude about their mean positions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_0.wav,307662,in this module you will learn about hitlers beliefs his popularity and his rise to power in germany
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_10.wav,275898,in 1919 hitler was sent to inspect and influence the german workers party instead he got impressed with their ideas with his excellent oratory skills his devotion to german pride and his growing anti jewish sentiments hitler became an excellent spokesman for the party and was elected the party leader two years later
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_11.wav,530016,for the next decade hitler and the renamed german workers party which was now called the national socialist german workers party used various propaganda to reach out to the german people
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_12.wav,522492,they held marches conducted parades and gave strong speeches at massive rallies where he spoke against the treaty of versailles the weimar constitution and jews
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_13.wav,912866,nazi propaganda also included nazi iconic symbols such as the nazi salute the swastika and the eagle atop the swastika hitlers powerful speeches and grand rallies were reinforced through colourful posters and flyers the waving red flags further added to the aggressive energy of nazi parades
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_14.wav,924570,when hitler got arrested after a failed coup to take over the weimar in 1923 he wrote his famous autobiography mein kampf or my struggle his beliefs resonated with the german peoples insecurities of a stable future mein kampf was a bestseller and motivated germans to fight for their pride
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_15.wav,738160,while his racist aggressive campaigning was questionable his devotion to germany was not people had lost faith in the unstable weimar which had forgotten the plight of the german worker and soldier they were praying for a saviour and they got one

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_2.wav,452276,born in 1889 in an austrian village called braunau am inn hitler was raised by an over protective mother and a disciplinarian father
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_3.wav,679646,he wanted to be a painter but his father wanted to him to be a civil servant they often fought and hitler got beaten but he never gave up his dreams at the age of 17 he applied to art school in vienna but got rejected
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_4.wav,847666,while he worked odd jobs in vienna to make ends meet he often heard anti semitic speeches these speeches attacked all non german speaking people and listed ways to control the entry of jewish immigrants into austria hungary soon hitler developed a dislike for the jewish community
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_5.wav,584350,desperate to change his life hitler left for munich in 1913 and enrolled in the german army world war one had broken out hitler fought the allied armies and was often exposed to enemy fire
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_6.wav,586022,but his efforts did not go unnoticed hitler received the iron cross a military recognition for bravery twice these awards just marked the beginning of hitlers quick road to global recognition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_7.wav,497416,in 1918 world war one ended germany elected a new government called the weimar republic and signed the versailles peace treaty in 1919
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/hitler_8.wav,781628,this upset many germans especially war heroes like hitler they argued that when the german army had remained undefeated in the field why was the weimar government accepting the harsh and demeaning terms of the versailles treaty

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_1.wav,285928,back in the year 1865 most of the basic means of livelihood of the forest dwelling tribes were banned by the british
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_2.wav,238280,lets see what happened the forest tribes were largely dependent on the forest for their livelihoods
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_3.wav,321872,villagers thought a good forest was one that provided them with their daily needs such as fuel fodder and leaves
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_4.wav,498252,however the british thought differently they felt a good forest was one that provided timber for building ships and railways teak and sal were the most popular trees
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_5.wav,261686,for this purpose the british passed the indian forest act which completely devastated the lives of villagers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_6.wav,404628,the daily practices of villagers such as cutting wood grazing cattle collecting fruits and roots and fishing were banned and made illegal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_7.wav,468158,forest dwelling tribes largely depended on hunting small animals like deer rabbit and partridge for food the british also imposed a ban on the hunting of small animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_8.wav,372864,however they encouraged the sport of hunting of wild and dangerous animals like the elephant lion and tiger by giving rewards
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/indian_forest_act_9.wav,219054,in fact if anyone was caught hunting illegally they were severely punished for poaching
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_0.wav,193142,in this module you will be introduced to nazism and hitler
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_10.wav,294288,a tribunal was set up in the german city of nuremberg to prosecute nazi leaders and punish them for their crimes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_11.wav,631162,adolf hitler was not tried at nuremberg as he had committed suicide on 30 april 1945 a month before world war two ended but twelve other leading nazi generals were sentenced to death by the tribunal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_12.wav,1039926,the nuremberg trials speak of countless crimes committed by adolf hitler and his nazi government besides invading foreign countries the nazi government tortured and killed six million jews 200 000 gypsies one million polish civilians and 70 000 mentally challenged germans all in an effort keep germany only for pure germans
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_13.wav,755714,nazi germanys efforts to eliminate the jews and other communities are referred to as genocidal crimes the term genocide was coined in 1944 to describe the act of destroying a community based on nationalism racism religion or ethnicity
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_14.wav,305154,the term was accepted by the united nations under international law after nazi war criminals were persecuted at nuremberg
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_15.wav,353638,the genocide committed by nazi germany between 1933 and 1945 is referred to as the holocaust
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_16.wav,458964,it overlapped with hitlers ambition to conquer the world by sparking off world war two the effects of both these catastrophic events reverberate through the world even today
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_1.wav,703888,for six long years 30 countries fought ruthlessly day and night more than 60 million people died and nuclear weapons were used for the first time in history this was the second world war the most destructive event of modern times
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_2.wav,729800,the warring countries were divided into two military alliances the allied powers and the axis powers the allied powers were led by the united states the united kingdom and france the axis powers were led by germany italy and japan
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_3.wav,709738,at the heart of the conflict was germany led by adolf hitler and his national socialist german workers party or in short the nazi party when hitlers party came to power in 1933 everyone started to refer to germany as nazi germany
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_4.wav,392926,nazi germany was based on an ideology called nazism or national socialism that promoted violent practices to restore german pride
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_5.wav,369520,nazism gave the german people new hope it promised not only to restore german pride but also to pull germany out of recession
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_6.wav,418004,in september 1939 in order to conquer more land and resources for the german people hitler invaded poland sparking off world war two
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_7.wav,400448,first france and the uk fought germany to defend poland soon more and more countries joined either the allied or the axis powers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_8.wav,207352,both sides exhausted each other fighting on land underwater and in the skies
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/intro_9.wav,364504,when the bloodshed finally ended in 1945 the allied powers demanded justice from the defeated axis powers especially germany
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_10.wav,385402,crop rotation and enclosures were beneficial to the rich landlords and for their grain production however the life of the poor became more miserable
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_11.wav,361996,not only were the poor driven out from the common lands they could no longer use the common land for their daily activities as the land now belonged to the landlords
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_12.wav,524164,some areas like midlands were more affected by the age of enclosures than their surrounding counties in midlands almost the entire landscape was divided into pieces of land surrounded by enclosures
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_13.wav,296796,people from these areas started migrating to the southern counties of england to find work as agricultural labourers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_14.wav,509118,however they still faced the trouble of finding secure jobs the rich landlords started the practice of hiring labourers only during the harvest season to cut costs and increase their profits
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_15.wav,167228,meanwhile the napoleonic wars brought further agony for the poor
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_17.wav,332740,to meet the demands for food and to avoid dependence of hired labour the landlords began buying new threshing machines available in the market
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_18.wav,196484,however the introduction of threshing machines sparked riots across the country
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_19.wav,477354,the english landlords across the country received threatening letters signed by a mythical captain swing these letters urged them to stop using the threshing machines that deprived labourers of their livelihood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_20.wav,489056,many fields were burnt and destroyed at night by the rioters threshing machines were also broken the captain swing riots as it was commonly known instilled a fear amongst the rich landlords
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_21.wav,398778,with the end of the napoleonic wars food grains from europe started flowing in and the grain prices fell causing an agricultural depression to set in
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_22.wav,227414,the landlords were forced to reduce the area under cultivation as well as the amount of labour they used
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_23.wav,327724,the new age agriculture of enclosures and threshing machines brought a lot of misery to the poor and short lived profits for the landlords
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_2.wav,277568,its not a nice feeling to be enclosed and stuck in a confined space
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_3.wav,368684,lets go back in time and see how the people of england felt when enclosures came up around them and changed their entire landscape and life
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_4.wav,234938,the period after the 1780s was unique in terms of the history of agriculture in england
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_5.wav,306826,this was the first time in englands history when the rapid population growth was being equally met by an increase in grain production
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_6.wav,296796,this large scale grain production took its toll on the earlier open field agriculture system that was being practised in england
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_7.wav,596890,the open fields were covered with enclosures now the rich landlords did everything in their power such as slice up pasturelands cut up forest commons take over marshes to convert all the possible areas into agricultural fields
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_8.wav,204008,an increase in grain production was achieved through simple innovations as crop rotation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/land_enclosure_9.wav,336084,clover and turnip was grown in abundance not only were they good fodder for the cattle but it also made the soil very fertile
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_10.wav,426362,the next part of the leaf is the mesophyll which is located between the upper and the lower epidermis it is also called the green tissue of the leaf as it contains chloroplasts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_11.wav,193142,the mesophyll is made up of parenchyma and performs photosynthesis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_12.wav,326052,in dicot leaves the mesophyll tissue is differentiated as palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_13.wav,500760,the palisade parenchyma located near the adaxial epidermis is made up of elongated cells arranged vertically and parallel to each other these cells have fewer intercellular spaces
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_14.wav,296796,the spongy parenchyma is located just below the palisade parenchyma and it extends up to the abaxial epidermis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_15.wav,234102,it consists of round cells which are loosely arranged and have large intercellular spaces and air cavities
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_16.wav,193978,the third part of a dicot leaf is the vascular system comprising vascular bundles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_17.wav,255836,when observed under a microscope vascular bundles can be seen in the veins and the midrib of the leaf
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_18.wav,415496,the size of the vascular bundles depends on the size of the vein in dicot plants the leaves have reticulate venation in which the veins are of different sizes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_19.wav,198156,therefore the vascular bundles are found irregularly scattered in the mesophyll
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_20.wav,201500,in the large veins vascular bundles are usually surrounded by a bundle sheath
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_21.wav,450604,lets take a look at a monocot leaf now it is also known as an isobilateral leaf which means it is identical on both sides of its axis and shows parallel venation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_22.wav,301810,the anatomy of a monocot leaf is similar to that of a dicot leaf however there are also some key differences
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_23.wav,417168,unlike a dicot leaf where stomata are found in greater numbers in the abaxial epidermis in a monocot leaf stomata are present on both surfaces of the epidermis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_24.wav,300974,moreover the mesophyll cells are not differentiated as palisade and spongy parenchyma in a monocot leaf
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_25.wav,486548,the vascular bundles in a dicot leaf are irregularly scattered due to reticulate venation in a monocot leaf however they are arranged in a parallel manner in the mesophyll due to parallel venation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_26.wav,506610,in the leaves of monocots such as grasses veins and cells of the upper epidermis modify themselves as large bubble shaped colourless cells also known as bulliform cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_27.wav,215710,on absorption of water bulliform cells become turgid and expose the leafs surface
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_28.wav,725622,conversely in water stress situations there is loss of turgor pressure and bulliform cells become flaccid as a result the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss hence a lot of activity goes on in the internal structure of a leaf
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_29.wav,243296,since major food production takes place in leaves they are aptly known as the plants powerhouse of energy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_2.wav,219890,in this module you will learn about the anatomy of dicot and monocot leaves
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_4.wav,323544,they perform many crucial functions such as photosynthesis and transpiration in which their internal structure plays an important role
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_5.wav,259178,a dicot leaf is also known as dorsiventral as its upper and lower sides are different in structure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_6.wav,401284,on observing the transverse section of a dicot leaf we find that it has three main parts epidermis mesophyll and the vascular system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_7.wav,232430,the epidermis covers the upper and lower surfaces of the leaf and is coated with the cuticle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_8.wav,410480,the epidermis covering the upper surface of leaf is called the adaxial epidermis while that covering the lower surface is called the abaxial epidermis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/leaves_9.wav,367012,typically the abaxial epidermis has more stomata compared to the adaxial epidermis which sometimes may not have any stomata at all
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_10.wav,424848,each tooth of the driving gear acts as a small lever of class one and pushes the tooth of the driven gear one after the other and thus rotates the driven gear
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_11.wav,297788,the driving gear and the driven gear are engaged with each other either externally or internally
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_12.wav,378874,if two gear wheels mounted on their respective axles make an external contact the gear system is said to be engaged externally
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_13.wav,383052,if the gears are engaged externally the direction of rotation of the driving gear is opposite to the direction of rotation of the driven gear
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_14.wav,410638,that is if the driving gear rotates in clockwise direction then the driven gear rotates in anticlockwise direction and vice versa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_15.wav,702374,lets now learn about the gears that are engaged internally if a gear having cogs on its inner surface is engaged with a gear having cogs on its outer surface then such a gear system is said to be engaged internally and the gear is said to be an internal gear
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_16.wav,374694,if the gears are engaged internally the direction of rotation of the driving gear and the direction of rotation of the driven gear is the same
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_17.wav,393084,that is if the driving gear is rotated in the clockwise direction the driven gear too rotates in the clockwise direction and vice versa
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_18.wav,305312,now let us study about the principle of gears and the terms speed ratio and gear ratio
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_19.wav,908846,the gear system works on the mechanical principle of the wheel and axle that is for one complete revolution of the wheel and axle the effort is displaced through the circumference of the wheel and the load is displaced through the circumference of the axle in a gear system the larger gear represents the wheel and the smaller gear the axle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_1.wav,188282,speed ratio and gear ratio of a train of gears
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_20.wav,306984,to understand the mechanism of a gear system we need to understand the terms speed ratio and gear ratio
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_21.wav,408966,let us learn about the meaning of these two terms with the help of a gear system comprising two gears say a and b connected externally
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_22.wav,480020,let r a and r b be the radii and n a and n b be the number of teeth or cogs of the gears a and b respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_23.wav,731630,let a be the driving gear and b the driven gear then the speed ratio is defined as the ratio of the angular speed of the driven gear omega b to the angular speed of the driving gear omega a let us now derive the mathematical expression for speed ratio
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_24.wav,497574,as the gears a and b form a gear system the linear distance along the circumference of each cog on the driver gear is equal to the linear distance along the circumference of each cog on the driven gear
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_25.wav,775934,but the linear distance along the circumference for each cog on the driver gear is equal to two pi r a upon n a and the linear distance along the circumference for each cog on the driven gear is equal to two pi r b upon n b
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_26.wav,795160,now as the linear distance along the circumference for each cog on the driver gear is equal to the linear distance along the circumference for each cog on the driven gear two pi r a upon n a is equal to two pi r b upon n b
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_27.wav,662250,on cancelling two pi from both the sides of the equation and after simplifying we get r b upon r a is equal to n b upon n a let us consider this as equation one
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_28.wav,696522,but the angular speed omega is equal to two pi n which is further equal to v upon r where n represents the number of rotations per second v is the linear speed of the gear and r is the radius of the gear
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_2.wav,276054,in this module you will learn about the speed ratio and gear ratio of train of gears
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_30.wav,897142,from equations one and two we get speed ratio is equal to omega b upon omega a which is equal to n b upon n a which is equal to r a upon r b which is further equal to n a upon n b let us consider this equation as equation five
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_31.wav,971540,thus the number of teeth n a and n b radii r a and r b and the number of rotations per second n a and n b are related as n a upon n b is equal to n b upon n a is equal to r b upon r a
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_32.wav,546056,n a upon n b is known as the gear ratio in other words gear ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of cogs in the driving gear to the number of cogs in the driven gear
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_33.wav,267696,thus we have learnt about the mechanism of gears and the speed ratio and gear ratio
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_3.wav,426518,have you ever observed a driver changing the gear of a vehicle the driver changes the gear to increase or decrease the speed of the vehicle or to reverse the vehicle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_4.wav,381378,a gear is an important component of a vehicle that changes its speed and direction let us now learn more about gears and its mechanism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_5.wav,466642,a gear is a wheel with tooth around its rim that transmits energy from the point of application to the required point the tooth of a gear is called the cog
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_6.wav,338746,gears are mounted on their respective axles such that the teeth of different gears interlock making one gear rotate the other
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_7.wav,488376,the system formed by a set of two or more gears that are interlocked and allows one gear to turn the other is called a train of gears or gear train or system of gears or gear system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_8.wav,211688,the interlocking of gears is known as engaging or meshing
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/machines_9.wav,826924,in a gear system the gear that is attached or fixed to the power source such as an electric motor a hand crank the sail of a windmill a gasoline engine or a turbine is known as the driver gear or driving gear and all the other gears of the gear system are known as driven gears
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_10.wav,213204,pem occurs across all age groups but is more prevalent in children
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_11.wav,241624,the two common forms of pem are kwashiorkor and marasmus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_12.wav,286764,kwashiorkor is caused by severe protein deficiency seen in infants who are around twelve months old
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_13.wav,375372,this protein deficiency occurs mainly due to immediate pregnancy and delivery of the second child wherein the mother breast feeds the second child
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_14.wav,178930,and substitutes breast milk with starchy food for the first child
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_15.wav,305990,as a result the starch rich diet fed to the first child gives energy but provides inadequate amount of proteins
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_16.wav,522492,the occurrence of this condition is the main reason behind naming it as kwashiorkor which means the disease the first child gets when the second one is born in the ga language spoken in ghana
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_17.wav,418840,although kwashiorkor is more prevalent in infants below twelve months of age it can also affect children between upto three years of age if their daily intake of protein is less
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_18.wav,357818,children affected by kwashiorkor exhibit certain typical symptoms related to body structure facial characteristics and brain development
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_19.wav,434722,as far as body structure is concerned the child exhibits stunted growth and the legs become very thin and curved the stomach becomes swollen
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_20.wav,225742,due to the retention of water by the cells and this condition is called oedema
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_21.wav,391254,coming to facial characteristics the eyes appear bulged skin gets scaly and peels off and hair becomes reddish before the age of five
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_22.wav,464814,furthermore because deficiency of proteins and energy affects the structural and functional development of the brain the affected children show mild to low mental and behavioural development
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_23.wav,235772,in extreme cases kwashiorkor can be fatal if timely treatment is not given

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_25.wav,382058,the affected children can be treated by providing them with a proteinrich diet which should include more than one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_26.wav,322708,proteinrich diet may include a combination of wheat gram soya beans peanuts and jaggery
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_28.wav,405464,now let us look at another type of pem called marasmus which occurs due to inadequate intake of food in other words starvation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_2.wav,185618,in this module you will learn about protein energy malnutrition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_30.wav,247476,this is because people below the poverty line cannot afford a basic meal a day for their children
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_31.wav,300974,at the same time since there is a deficiency of proteins the tissue proteins are used up for producing energy in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_32.wav,274226,this process of the body breaking down its own tissue to synthesise energy is known as muscle wasting
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_33.wav,438902,this concept is the reason behind naming this condition as marasmus which is derived form the greek word marasmos meaning withering or wasting
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_34.wav,252492,the symptoms of marasmus include a weak body with loose skin and bones with the ribs visible

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_38.wav,278404,on the whole the affected child appears dull and is both physically and mentally retarded
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/malnutrition_39.wav,388746,the preventive and control measures for marasmus are the same as that for kwashiorkor that is to provide the child with a balanced proteinrich diet

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/national_dress_6.wav,364504,it was jnanadanandini devi wife of satyendranath tagore who first adopted the parsi style of wearing a saree in the late 1870s
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/national_dress_7.wav,205680,this saree was pinned to the left shoulder with a brooch and worn with a blouse and shoes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/national_dress_8.wav,286764,this style was then adopted by brahmo samaji women and hence came to be known as the brahmika saree
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/national_dress_9.wav,275898,soon this style was accepted by brahmos and non brahmos in maharashtra and uttar pradesh
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_0.wav,218218,in this module you will learn about the movement of the nomadic pastoralists of india
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_10.wav,173080,come september we begin our downward journey towards our winter base
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_11.wav,342770,actually we are not the only ones who have this kind of a lifestyle my friend here is part of the gaddi shepherd tribe of himachal pradesh
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_12.wav,250820,the gaddi shepherds also use the low hills of the siwalik as their winter base just like us
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_13.wav,418004,by april they move towards the mountains and spend the summer in lahul and spiti as the snow melts they move further up the mountains
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_14.wav,338590,on their return journey towards the winter base they stop at lahul and spiti to reap their summer harvest and sow the winter crop
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_15.wav,561782,another tribe the gujjar cattle herders who live further to the east in garhwal and kumaon come down to the dry forests of the bhabar in the winter and go up to the high meadows the bugyals in the summer
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_16.wav,305990,the sherpas bhotiyas and kinnauris of the himalayas are other nomadic tribes of this region
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_17.wav,535868,now that we ve see nomads from the mountains lets meet the dhangars who are a pastoral community of the central plateau of maharashtra consisting of shepherds blanket weavers and buffalo herders
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_18.wav,553422,during the monsoon they stay in the central plateau of maharashtra which is a semi arid region with low rainfall and poor soil this is an ideal place for their livestock as sheep cannot tolerate the wet monsoon conditions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_19.wav,240788,dry crops like bajra are grown and the area also provides a grazing ground for their flocks
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_1.wav,216546,have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in different places as the seasons change
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_20.wav,235772,after the harvest in october they move west in search of pastures to reach konkan
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_21.wav,453112,konkan is a rich agricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil the dhangars flocks help manure the fields in konkan to make it ready for the rabi harvest
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_22.wav,442244,with the onset of the monsoon the dhangars return to the plateau the people of konkan give them supplies of rice which prove very useful on the plateau where grain is scarce
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_23.wav,514970,there are other pastoral communities in karnataka and andhra pradesh such as the gollas kurumas and kurubas meet seenu he belongs to the gollas pastoral community
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_24.wav,291780,the gollas herd cattle whereas the kurumas and kurubas rear sheep and goats and sell woven blankets
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_25.wav,216546,in the dry season they all move to the coastal tracts and leave when the monsoon arrives
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_26.wav,386238,there are other groups of grazers such as the banjaras who are found in uttar pradesh punjab rajasthan madhya pradesh and maharashtra
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_27.wav,311842,they move in search of pastureland for their cattle selling plough cattle and other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_28.wav,158032,moving to the deserts the raikas are a nomadic tribe of rajasthan
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_29.wav,308498,they combine cultivation with pastoralism to overcome the difficulties posed by the meagre and uncertain rainfall in the region
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_2.wav,340262,nomads are people who move from one place to the other to escape harsh weather and to find conditions suitable to earn a livelihood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_30.wav,311006,during the monsoon the raikas of barmer jaisalmer jodhpur and bikaner stay in their villages
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_31.wav,304318,by october when the grazing grounds are dry they move in search of other pastures and water and return during the next monsoon
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_32.wav,337756,there are two other groups maru also known as the desert raikas who herd camels and another group who rear sheep and goat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_33.wav,897820,as you can see nomadic pastoralists adjust their movements and activities according to the surrounding conditions to make a living unlike mountain pastoralists whose movement is controlled by the cold and the snow it is the alternation of the monsoon and the dry season that governs the cyclic movements of pastoralists in the plateaus plains and deserts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_3.wav,357818,there are different communities of nomadic pastoralists in india pastoralists are people who earn their living by raising and herding livestock
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_4.wav,391254,as you already know india is made up of different kinds of geographical terrains such as mountains plateaus plains and deserts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_5.wav,220726,the nomads living in these different terrains follow various seasonal movements to earn their livelihood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_6.wav,330232,lets first meet some nomads living in the mountains i m omar part of the gujjar bakarwals from jammu and kashmir
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_7.wav,166392,we raise herds of goats and sheep and earn a living through our livestock
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_8.wav,387910,let me tell you something interesting about us we follow an annual cyclic movement between winter and summer for grazing grounds to find pasture for our herds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nomads_9.wav,712246,in the winter when the mountains are covered with snow we live in the low hills of the siwalik range while in the summer several of our households journey together in a procession as a single group known as a kafila we head upwards to the mountainside which is lush during april
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_10.wav,361996,all the processes involved in nutrition in human beings take place in the various digestive organs which together formsthe digestive system
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_11.wav,244968,the process by which an organism consumes or takes in food is called ingestion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_12.wav,161376,different living organisms ingest food in different ways
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_13.wav,403792,for example we eat food through our mouth hence the mouth is the body part where ingestion takes place in human beings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_14.wav,677138,the next step in nutrition is digestion the process in which complex insoluble substances in the food are split into simpler soluble molecules is called digestion these simple soluble substances are also called nutrients
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_18.wav,174750,the digestive enzymes break down the complex food molecules such as
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_19.wav,388746,carbohydrates into simpler sugar units proteins into amino acids and fats into glycerol and fatty acids respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_20.wav,517478,the next step in nutrition is absorption it is the process in which nutrients formed as a result of digestion are absorbed from the digestive tract into the blood vessels and lymph vessels
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_21.wav,591874,the blood vessels absorb nutrients such as simple sugar units amino acids vitamins minerals and even water molecules from the digestive tract and distribute the same to different parts of the body through blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_22.wav,404628,the lymph vessels on the other hand absorb fatty acids from the digestive tract and distribute the same to all parts of the body through the lymph
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_23.wav,190634,the maximum absorption of nutrients takes place within the small intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_24.wav,597726,do you know that in lower organisms such as amoeba the food molecules are ingested and digested within the vesicles thereafter the nutrients produced in the vesicles are directly absorbed into the protoplasm
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_25.wav,649552,after absorption the next step in nutrition is assimilation the process in which the absorbed nutrients are utilised by the tissues and cells of the body for growth repair and for energy generation is called assimilation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_26.wav,265866,the cells take in the required nutrients from the blood or lymph and assimilate them in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_27.wav,480698,the final step in nutrition is egestion it is the process of eliminating the undigested food in the form of faeces from the body through the large intestine and anus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_28.wav,360324,once the soluble molecules are absorbed from the small intestine the left out undigested food enters into the large intestine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_29.wav,417168,when the undigested food moves through the large intestine water is reabsorbed and the waste is expelled through the anus in the form of faeces
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_30.wav,590202,hence we can conclude that the steps in nutrition namely ingestion digestion absorption assimilation and egestion are required for the growth and survival of living organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_4.wav,681318,food provides us with the energy to carry out life processes which include nutrition consuming the food and digesting it respiration deriving energy from it excretion removing the waste from the body and responding to the environmental stimuli
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_5.wav,468994,among these life processes the basic process that is nutrition further includes procuring the food absorbing the nutrients and utilising them in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_6.wav,282584,nutrition is of two types namely autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic nutrition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_7.wav,256670,autotrophic mode of nutrition is exhibited by green plants by the process of photosynthesis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_8.wav,311006,while heterotrophic mode of nutrition is exhibited by all animals including humans and non green plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/nutrition_9.wav,509118,nutrition in animals is a complex process which occurs in five basic steps namely ingestion digestion absorption assimilation and egestion
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_10.wav,295124,the body obtains its water from the food and drinks consumed in a day and this water gets assimilated into the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_11.wav,185618,thus the water gets circulated throughout the body along with the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_12.wav,357818,when blood is filtered by the functional units of the kidney called nephrons the excess water present in it is excreted in the form of urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_13.wav,373700,let us now learn how water levels are regulated in the blood through osmoregulation during times of low or high amount of water in the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_14.wav,290108,during summer body loses water in the form of sweat leading to less amount of water in the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_15.wav,514134,the low amount of water in the blood is sensed by the osmoregulators of the brain that in turn signals the pituitary gland to secrete the antidiuretic hormone also known as adh
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_17.wav,180602,adh binds to the receptors on the collecting duct of the nephron
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_18.wav,346114,it triggers the reabsorption of water from the nephrons into the blood allowing less loss of water in the form of urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_19.wav,183946,this makes the urine concentrated and is called hypertonic urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_21.wav,302646,this is the reason why an individual urinates less during summer it prevents the individual from getting dehydrated
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_22.wav,249984,on the other hand during winter the body does not sweat and there is more water in the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_23.wav,182274,this excess amount of water in the blood is sensed by osmoregulators
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_24.wav,216546,it signals the brain to inhibit the secretion of adh from the pituitary gland
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_25.wav,303482,as a result when the blood with more water passes through the nephrons the water is not reabsorbed into the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_26.wav,271718,this leads to the loss of a large volume of water via the collecting duct of the nephron in the form of urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_27.wav,181438,this makes the urine diluted and is called as hypotonic urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_29.wav,366176,however the reabsorption of water by the kidneys to restore its volume in the blood is not always advantageous and can even prove fatal
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_2.wav,232430,in this module you will learn about the role of kidneys in osmoregulation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_30.wav,223234,in times of diseases like cholera where high amount of water is lost from the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_31.wav,464814,in such situations along with water more amount of urea is also reabsorbed back into the blood making it toxic this accumulated toxic urea
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_32.wav,195648,may lead to poisoning of the blood and even cause death of the patient
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_33.wav,562618,to overcome such situations cholera patients are immediately given glucose saline drip or oral rehydration solution commonly known as ors to replenish water and salts in the blood
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_34.wav,374536,in addition to the regulation of water levels in the body through osmoregulation let us now understand the gain and loss of water in the human body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_35.wav,319364,on an average the daily gain and loss of water in a healthy adult at rest in temperate climate are in equilibrium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_36.wav,300974,however the inflow and outflow of water varies with the climate and lifestyle of people living in different regions
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_37.wav,324380,interestingly an adult human body contains about forty litres of water which forms sixty per cent of the body weight
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_38.wav,255000,let us now take a look at the different foods and activities that balance the inflow and outflow of water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_39.wav,796674,a normal adult human body gains two thousand five hundred millilitres of water everyday in different ways like one thousand five hundred millilitres through drinking water and beverages accounting for sixty per cent and seven hundred millilitres through food accounting for twentyfive per cent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_3.wav,398778,do you know that kidneys filter the blood in the human body around four hundred times a day and excrete thousand to two thousand millilitres of urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_40.wav,421346,additionally cellular respiration occurring in all the body cells yields three hundred millilitres of metabolic water which accounts for fifteen per cent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_41.wav,631162,on the other hand the body loses the same amount of water in different ways including one thousand five hundred millilitres as urine accounting for sixty per cent five hundred millilitres as sweat accounting for twenty per cent
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_42.wav,545062,four hundred millilitres during breathing accounting for sixteen per cent and hundred millilitres in faeces and intestinal waste accounting for four per cent of the water lost
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_43.wav,356982,thus we have learnt about the role of kidneys in osmoregulation and in maintaining the concentration of water and salts in the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_4.wav,425526,kidneys are the excretory organs that play a major role in filtering blood and removing excess water and nitrogenous wastes from it in the form of urine
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_5.wav,273390,the kidneys while removing wastes from the blood also regulate the percentage of water and salts in it
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_6.wav,396270,this process of regulating the concentration of water and salts in the body fluids and also maintaining optimum osmotic pressure is called osmoregulation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_7.wav,273390,the word osmoregulation was coined by the scientist rudolf hober in the year 1902
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_8.wav,553422,osmoregulation is usually undertaken by the excretory organs such as nephridia contractile vacuoles and malphigian tubules in invertebrates and by kidneys in vertebrates
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/osmoregulation_9.wav,241624,to understand osmoregulation let us first understand how water enters the body
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_10.wav,372028,he also studied plant cells and concluded that in addition to a cell membrane plant cells also have a cell wall a characteristic unique to plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_11.wav,355310,schleiden and schwann together formulated the cell theory which stated that both plants and animals are made up of cells and their products such as proteins and lipids
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_12.wav,698872,however the cell theory did not explain the formation of new cells which was clarified by rudolf virchow in 1855 he coined the latin phrase omnis cellulae cellula which meant that new cells arise from pre existing cells and accordingly modified the cell theory
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_13.wav,309334,which now states that all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells and these cells arise from pre existing cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_14.wav,313514,cell research received a further boost with the invention of the electron microscope as it enabled scientists to observe the structure of the cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_15.wav,422182,they observed that the structure of a cell varies in plants and animals a plant cell for instance is surrounded by a distinct cell wall on the outside and a plasma membrane on the inside
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_16.wav,255000,whereas an animal cell lacks a cell wall and has a plasma membrane instead that forms the outer cell boundary
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_17.wav,309334,both animal and plant cells have a dense and spherical structure called the nucleus which contains thread like structures called chromosomes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_18.wav,303482,each chromosome is made of deoxyribonucleic acid or dna which stores the genetic information of the organism
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_19.wav,188126,if the nucleus is membrane bound then the cell is called a eukaryotic cell
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_20.wav,260850,they are found in members of kingdom protista kingdom fungi kingdom plantae and kingdom animalia
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_21.wav,366176,on the other hand cells without a membrane bound nucleus are called prokaryotic cells and members of kingdom monera possess such cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_22.wav,316022,both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are filled with cytoplasm a semi fluid matrix present inner to the cell membrane
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_23.wav,341098,however in an eukaryotic cell the cytoplasm does not include the nucleoplasm the nucleus matrix filled with the contents of the nucleus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_24.wav,282584,cytoplasm is a hub of activities and chemical reactions such as protein synthesis that help the cell remain alive
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_25.wav,176422,suspended inside the cytoplasm are distinct structures called organelles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_26.wav,613608,in eukaryotic cells we find membrane bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum the golgi complex lysosomes mitochondria microbodies and vacuoles as well as non membrane bound organelles such as ribosomes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_27.wav,368684,interestingly ribosomes are also found in chloroplasts of plant cells as well as the mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum of both plants and animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_28.wav,266702,moreover animal cells possess another non membrane bound organelle called the centriole which aids in cell division

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_31.wav,847666,for instance mycoplasma measure only 0 3 microns in length whereas human red blood cells are about seven microns in diameter and nerve cells measure around four to hundred microns amazingly the ostrich egg is the largest isolated single cell and it measures seventeen to nineteen centimetres in length and fourteen to fifteen centimetres in width
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_32.wav,260014,moreover the shapes of cells range from disc like to thread like and from polygonal to columnar and cuboid
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_33.wav,325216,today though we have gained a lot of information about cells scientists are still engaged in unlocking the secrets of the cell and its organelles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_3.wav,255000,millions of animal and plant species of varying sizes and shapes inhabit the earth and they all have one thing in common
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_4.wav,184782,they are all made up of cells the fundamental unit of life in living organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_5.wav,188962,scientists didnt know about the existence of cells until the invention of the microscope
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_6.wav,335248,anton von leeuwenhoek an amateur dutch scientist is credited as the first person to see and describe living cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_7.wav,254164,later robert brown expanded on leeunwenhoeks studies and pointed to the presence of a cell nucleus
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_8.wav,410480,in 1838 german botanist matthias schleiden examined numerous plant species and concluded that plants have different types of cells which form plant tissues
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/overview_cell_9.wav,484876,a year later theodore schwann a british zoologist examined different animal cells and discovered that the cells have a thin outer layer which we now know as the cell or plasma membrane
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_10.wav,283420,depending on the concentration of the pollutants and the duration of exposure plants and animals are affected in different ways
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_11.wav,474846,when plants are exposed to polluted air they may exhibit leaf blade damage cellular collapse premature aging reduced growth and crop yields or the plants may even die
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_12.wav,282584,like plants the harmful effects of air pollutants are seen in animals including human beings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_13.wav,366176,eye and nasal irritation headache shortness of breath and respiratory diseases are some of the harmful effects of air pollutants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_14.wav,301810,every year the health of people and roadside plants has been deteriorating due to a continuous rise in air pollution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_16.wav,337756,in 1986 our government passed the environment protection act with a view to take preventive actions to control environmental pollution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_17.wav,500760,this act made several industries thermal power plants and smelters adopt various methods to separate or filter particulate and gaseous matter that were released into the atmosphere through their smokestacks
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_18.wav,459800,one of the most widely used methods to filter particulate matter uses an electrostatic precipitator which is capable of removing over 99 per cent of particulate matter present in industrial exhaust
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_19.wav,336084,another method requires the use of scrubbers however this method is incapable of removing very tiny particulate matter
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_20.wav,450604,according to the central pollution control board or cpcb particulate matter measuring 2 point 5 micrometers or less in diameter is responsible for causing many respiratory diseases
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_21.wav,257506,apart from pollutants released from industries automobile exhausts are also a potent source of air pollution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_22.wav,324380,with the ever increasing number of vehicles in our country it has become essential to take proper measures to minimise the release of vehicular exhausts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_23.wav,295960,for instance the use of catalytic converters and unleaded petrol or diesel has helped reduce vehicular pollution considerably
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_24.wav,341098,did you know that catalytic converters contain catalysts made of expensive metals such as platinum palladium and rhodium
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_25.wav,428034,when fitted into vehicles a catalytic converter changes poisonous exhaust gases such as un burnt hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_26.wav,457292,likewise carbon monoxide and nitric oxide are converted into carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas respectively catalytic converters thus reduce the emission of poisonous gases
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_27.wav,321872,however vehicles fitted with catalytic converters should use unleaded petrol as lead in the petrol inactivates the catalyst
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_28.wav,295960,in addition the use of compressed natural gas or cng has also proved very helpful in reducing air pollution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_29.wav,418840,interestingly the use of cng was accelerated when a public interest litigation was filed in the supreme court of india due to serious air pollution problems in delhi in the 1990s
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_2.wav,189798,in this module you will learn about air pollution and its control
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_30.wav,387074,the court asked the government to take appropriate measures in a specified time frame also included converting all diesel buses to cng buses
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_31.wav,276732,in fact by the end of 2002 all buses in delhi were running on cheaper and efficient cng
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_32.wav,377044,besides the use of cng unleaded petrol and catalytic converters the government of delhi has also taken several other measures to control air pollution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_33.wav,300138,this includes the use of low sulphur petrol and diesel and the implementation of stringent pollution level norms for vehicles
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_34.wav,293452,moreover the indian government formulated a new auto fuel policy to reduce vehicular pollution in other cities as well
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_35.wav,417168,this policy was based on the european standards or euro norms and took effect in 2000 these norms are more stringent and required vehicle engines to be upgraded
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_36.wav,206516,the implementation of these stringent norms has considerably improved air quality
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_37.wav,260014,however another air pollutant noise also required serious attention and so
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_38.wav,365340,amendments were made to the air prevention and control of pollution act which was implemented in india in 1981 to include noise as an air pollutant
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_39.wav,240788,noise is an undesirable high level of sound which has an adverse effect on human beings
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_3.wav,271718,every time you stop at a traffic signal you are compelled to cover your nose or else you end up breathing polluted air
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_40.wav,384566,studies show that exposure to a sound level of 150 decibels or more may damage the eardrum thereby permanently impairing hearing ability
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_41.wav,586022,in fact even prolonged exposure to lower sound levels such drilling and industrial noise could have the same effect noise also causes sleeplessness stress increased heartbeat and an altered breathing pattern
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_42.wav,324380,considering these harmful effects the government has taken stringent measures to regulate sound levels in cities as well as industrial belts
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_43.wav,381222,for instance in cities the areas around hospitals and schools have been declared no horn zones and time limits have been set for the use of loudspeakers
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_44.wav,416332,industries have also been encouraged to use sound absorbent materials and workers too who are exposed to loud sound levels are being encouraged by the government to use ear muffs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_45.wav,421346,although our country has several legislative measures to prevent and control air pollution it is our individual responsibility to control pollution levels to ensure a healthy environment
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_5.wav,700544,pollution simply put is an undesirable change in the physical chemical or biological characteristics of air water land or soil that may have detrimental effects on living organisms substances that bring about such undesirable changes are called pollutants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_6.wav,188126,the air we breathe has become highly polluted over the last decade
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_7.wav,263358,due to air pollutants such as automobile exhausts chemicals and toxic gases from industries and
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_8.wav,194812,natural particulate matter such as dust pollen and ash
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/pollution_9.wav,249984,these pollutants not only pollute the air but also have detrimental effects on all living organisms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_10.wav,260166,a dual control switch has three terminals say a b and c
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_11.wav,317010,the middle terminal b is common to both a and c and is connected to the live wire of the supply lines
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_12.wav,493388,so when the switch is flipped to a side say towards terminal c terminal b connects with terminal c and the circuit is closed and the electric current passes through the circuit
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_13.wav,496732,similarly when the switch is flipped towards terminal a the combination of terminals b and a get connected and the electric current passes through the circuit connected to terminal a
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_14.wav,378032,hence a dual control switch controls two different electric circuits one after the other but not both at the same time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_15.wav,378032,now let us study an example of how dual control switches are used to operate an electric bulb from the two ends of a staircase
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_16.wav,556918,while connecting the dual control switch for the staircase switch s one is fitted at the bottom of the staircase while switch s two is fitted after the topmost stair and the bulb is connected between them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_17.wav,262674,the switches s one and s two operate the connected electric bulb independently
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_18.wav,194130,let us now look at the working of the combination of these two switches
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_19.wav,441560,lets say the junction points in switch s one are a b c and for switch s two are d e f
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_20.wav,539364,so if switch s two is off and switch s one is used to operate the bulb the connection ba changes to bc which completes the circuit making the bulb glow
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_21.wav,558590,on the other hand if switch s one is off and switch s two is used to operate the bulb the connection ef changes to ed which again completes the circuit making the bulb glow
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_22.wav,312830,furthermore if the bulb is on then it can be turned off using either of the switches s one or s two
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_23.wav,239268,so when switch s one is used the connection changes from bc to ba
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_24.wav,235090,and when switch s two is used the connection changes from ed to ef
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_25.wav,485028,similar to the staircase wiring dual control switches can also be installed at the opposite ends of a long corridor and … at the entrance of a room and inside the room
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_27.wav,435710,dual control switches can be used to operate not only electric bulbs but also other electric appliances such as television fan and so on
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_28.wav,209176,thus we have looked into the construction and working of dual control switches
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_2.wav,194128,in this module you will learn about dual control switches
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_3.wav,274376,we know that an electrical appliance can be switched on or off using its corresponding electric switch
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_4.wav,562768,but imagine a long corridor with an electric bulb whose switch is located at one end of the corridor to switch on and switch off this bulb one has to walk from one end of the corridor to the other each time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_5.wav,528494,such a situation causes inconvenience so wouldnt it be better if there are two switches that can operate the electric bulb from both ends of the corridor how would this be possible
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_7.wav,515956,a dual control switch is a specially designed one that controls two electric circuits one at a time it is also known as a single pole double throw switch or spdt switch
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_8.wav,384716,in other words a dual control switch operates a single electrical appliance using two separate switches located at different places
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/power_9.wav,192456,let us now see the connections and working of dual control switches
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_10.wav,418840,the remains of dead animals plant wastes and droppings of animals all get buried in the soil and gradually transform into manure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_11.wav,335248,the seedlings depend on this manure which is the only source of nutrients for them to survive and grow into a complete plant
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_12.wav,185618,furthermore rain is the only source of water for these plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_13.wav,310170,our ancestors must have observed this phenomenon which is why they started producing new plants by way of seeds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_14.wav,268374,initially man collected seeds and raised new plants with the intention of procuring food for himself
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_15.wav,435558,in addition he started domesticating animals such as cow buffalo sheep and poultry to obtain food and raw materials
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_16.wav,445588,this practice of cultivating plants for food and rearing of animals to obtain meat milk eggs and other products is called agriculture
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_17.wav,299302,as a part of the development of agriculture man cleared forests and brought more land under cultivation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_18.wav,273390,he started growing a single type of plant over a large area and called the plant as crop
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_19.wav,563452,the crops that were cultivated included almost all edible plants such as rice wheat jowar gram groundnut mustard citrus fruits and green vegetables as food crops
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_20.wav,382894,and plants such as sudan grass rhodes grass and berseem grass as fodder crops to feed the domesticated animals
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_21.wav,449768,today agriculture involves cultivation of important crops through scientific methods known as agricultural practices to ensure a quality production
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_22.wav,359488,in fact farmers take the responsibility of raising new plants and nurturing them at every step in order to obtain a good yield
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_23.wav,263358,this is why cultivation of plants through agriculture ensures consistency and a proper yield of crops
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_24.wav,233266,thus we have learned how man started and developed the practice of agriculture
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_2.wav,183946,in this module you will learn about the advent of agriculture
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_3.wav,353638,do you know that many a time seeds germinate and plants grow on their own without any person sowing and nurturing them
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_4.wav,243296,plants are able to grow on their own with the help of nature let us see how
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_5.wav,297630,many wild plants grow in nature the seeds falling from the bursting of ripe fruits of these plants are
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_6.wav,319364,carried off to distant places by agents such as wind water animals and birds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_7.wav,252492,in some cases the pods burst open and the seeds get dispersed to distant places
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_8.wav,402956,the chances of germination of these seeds are very less because they are scattered over long distances and may not have favourable conditions to grow
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/quality_food_9.wav,259178,if some seeds happen to germinate the seedlings again depend on nature for nutrition
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_10.wav,356982,in adaptive divergence animals of the same or closely related group exhibit great divergence in their morphology when found in a different habitat
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_12.wav,207352,these finches had originally come from the south american mainland to the galapagos islands
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_13.wav,438902,with the passage of time they multiplied and began to compete with each other for food as a result all the food resources on the islands were used to the optimum
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_14.wav,287600,to take advantage of all the available food sources on the islands the finches adapted themselves to the different varieties of food
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_15.wav,244132,one observable trait that pointed to this adaptation was the altered beaks of different species of finches
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_16.wav,234102,their beaks divided them into specialised insectivorous and vegetarian varieties respectively
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_17.wav,362832,another type of adaptive radiation is adaptive convergence where animals of unrelated groups occupying same habitat exhibit common features
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_18.wav,453948,for example australian marsupials such as the kangaroo marsupial rat banded anteater tiger cat tasmanian wolf and koala
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_19.wav,265866,marsupial mammals are characterised by their pouch in which the female carries the young through the initial days of infancy
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_20.wav,647880,many different types of marsupials with different ancestry have evolved on the continent of australia this type of evolution where several adaptive radiations have occurred in an isolated geographical area with several habitats is known as convergent evolution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_21.wav,245804,on tracing the evolution of these marsupials it was found that the drifting of the continents had shaped their history
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_22.wav,941288,when the ancient landmasses of laurasia and gondwana broke apart to form separate continents the marsupials were also divided into two groups while one group of marsupials was isolated on the australian island the other group remained in south america thereafter the marsupials on both these continents evolved in a parallel manner and hence this is also known as parallel evolution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_23.wav,501596,interestingly on comparing marsupials and placental mammals of australia we find similar adaptive radiations between them although they have separate lineages they resemble each other physically
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_24.wav,334412,studies show that the impelling causes of adaptive radiation are the need for food safety and for better breeding grounds
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_25.wav,260014,thus the process of adaptive radiation illustrates how life forms have modified and evolved into new forms
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_3.wav,350294,during his long expedition on the hms beagle charles darwin carried out several interesting studies on the geology of different places
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_4.wav,393762,one of the observations crucial to his theory of evolution was made by him on the galapagos islands which are near the equator in the pacific ocean
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_5.wav,430542,the galapagos is an archipelago of volcanic islands with varied wildlife what amazed darwin most was the extensive variety of finches on these islands
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_6.wav,253328,these species of finches differed from each other with respect to the shape of their beaks and their overall size
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_7.wav,413824,darwin observed that all these species had evolved on these islands these finches also known as darwins finches demonstrated the concept of adaptive radiation
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_8.wav,452276,it is a type of evolution in which species in the same geographic area derived from a common ancestor successfully adapt themselves to their natural environment due to natural selection
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/radiation_9.wav,243296,adaptive radiation is of two types adaptive divergence and adaptive convergence
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_02.wav,186454,in this module you will learn about the anatomy of dicot and monocot roots
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_03.wav,423018,the root is one of the key organs that helps distinguish between a dicot and a monocot plant lets observe the transverse section of the matured zone of roots to understand their internal structure
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_05.wav,182274,the outermost single layered tissue of the dicot root is called the epidermis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_06.wav,254164,on the epidermis you will also find some extended epidermal cells which are unicellular root hairs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_07.wav,251656,the epidermis is followed by cortex which is formed of several layers of thin walled parenchymatous cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_09.wav,346950,the innermost layer of the cortex comprises barrel shaped cells without any intercellular spaces this layer is known as the endodermis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_10.wav,397106,the tangential and radial walls of the endodermal cells have deposits of a water impermeable material or suberin which is also called casparian strips
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_11.wav,216546,suberin is a waxy waterproof substance present in the cell walls of cork tissue in plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_12.wav,425526,going back to the transverse section of the dicot root after the endodermis a few layers of thick walled parenchymatous cells are present in the tissue this is known as the pericyle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_13.wav,284256,secondary growth such as initiation of lateral roots and vascular cambium takes place in the cells of the pericycle
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_14.wav,201500,notice that the pith in the tissue of the dicot root is extremely small and is undeveloped
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_15.wav,176422,typically there are two to four xylem and phloem patches in a dicot root
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_16.wav,197320,in the later stages a cambium ring gets formed between the xylem and phloem
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_17.wav,395434,some radially arranged parenchymatous cells are found between the vascular bundles these cells form the conjunctive tissue which is specialised for storage of water
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_18.wav,363668,the tissues present inside the endodermis namely the pericycle vascular bundles and pith are collectively known as stele
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_19.wav,295960,lets now take a look at how the monocot root is organised internally in many aspects it is similar to the dicot root
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_20.wav,440572,on comparing the two roots we find the monocot root also consists of epidermis cortex endodermis pericycle vascular bundle and pith
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_21.wav,423854,however there are some differences the monocot root can have many xylem bundles sometimes as many as six whereas the dicot root does not have quite as many
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_22.wav,168064,moreover in a monocot root the pith is well developed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_23.wav,317692,although dicot and monocot roots have some structural similarities they differ in the number of xylem bundles and size of the pith and cortex
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/root_24.wav,301810,moreover secondary growth takes place only in the dicot root in other words these roots thicken over time
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_10.wav,280912,the cortex comprises three sub zones namely the hypodermis the cortical layers and the endodermis
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_11.wav,249148,the hypodermis is the outermost zone of the cortex which consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_13.wav,267538,below the hypodermis are cortical layers of round and thin walled parenchymatous cells with intercellular spaces
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_14.wav,537540,the third or the innermost zone of the cortex is known as the endodermis it is a single layer of tightly packed rectangular cells which are rich in starch grains therefore this layer is also known as the starch sheath
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_15.wav,400448,lets now examine the composition of the stele which forms the last region of a dicot stem this region consists of the pericyle the vascular bundles and the pith
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_16.wav,391254,the pericycle is composed of sclerenchymatous cells and it lies on the inner side of the endodermis above the phloem cells these cells act as strengthening material
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_17.wav,321872,the vascular bundles are located in a ring on the inside of the pericycle this ring arrangement is a distinctive feature of the dicot stem
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_18.wav,265030,there are layers of radially arranged parenchymatous cells in between the vascular bundles which constitute the medullary ray
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_19.wav,249148,each vascular bundle in a dicot stem is conjoint open and consists of endarch protoxylem
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_21.wav,227414,it is composed of a large number of rounded parenchymatous cells with many intercellular spaces
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_22.wav,163048,now that you have learnt about the dicot stem lets study the monocot stem
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_23.wav,246640,the tissues of dicot and monocot stems are quite similar however there are some differences as well
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_24.wav,354474,in the monocot stem the hypodermis is composed of sclerenchymatous cells while in a dicot stem it is composed of collenchymatous cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_25.wav,682154,the monocot stem has scattered vascular bundles and their arrangement is conjoint and closed moreover water containing cavities are present within the vascular bundles on the other hand in a dicot stem the vascular bundles are arranged in a ring as conjoint and open
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_26.wav,307662,in a monocot stem each vascular bundle is surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath and parenchymatous ground tissue
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_27.wav,224906,moreover the vascular bundles on the periphery are smaller compared to the vascular bundles in the centre
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_28.wav,336920,therefore the essential differences between a monocot and dicot stem lies in the arrangement of the epidermis ground tissue and vascular tissue
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_2.wav,178930,in this module you will learn about the anatomy of dicot and monocot stem
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_3.wav,211532,a stem is the main axis or stalk of a plant and it develops from the plumule of a germinating seed
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_4.wav,182274,lets examine the internal structure of a stem in dicot and monocot plants
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_5.wav,358652,here is the transverse section of a dicot stem the regions of tissues in this stem include epidermis cortex and stele
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_6.wav,197320,the outermost layer of the stem or epidermis consists of a layer of closely packed cells
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_8.wav,196484,the epidermis also contains stomata and hair like outgrowths known as trichomes
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/stem_9.wav,471502,the next region of a dicot stem is the cortex it lies between the epidermis and the pericycle and consists of multiple layers of cells the main function of this region is storage of food material

/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_0.wav,207352,in this module you will learn about the role of women in the french revolution
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_1.wav,611936,women have played a silent but key role in times of crisis whether it was putting bread on the table or fighting for their rights they did it all however the participation of women in the revolutions has never been stressed upon much
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_2.wav,591874,women came into the forefront on october 5 1789 when they marched to versailles and brought king louis the sixteenth back to paris they wanted the king and government closer so they could keep an eye on their activities
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_3.wav,889462,to voice their opinions and interests political clubs were set up all over france of the sixty womens clubs that were initiated the society of revolutionary and republican women was the most popular the key issue raised by the society of revolutionary and republican women was equal political rights for women similar to the rights assigned to men
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_4.wav,852680,though many laws were introduced to improve the lives of women like schools made compulsory for girls marriage of own preference divorce legalised job training for women yet the women folk were unhappy with the constitution of 1791 they felt they were reduced to mere passive citizens denying them the right to vote
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_5.wav,746520,spearheading the cause of women from 1791 onwards was the eminent writer and political activist olympe de gouges she fervently opposed the constitution and the declaration of rights of man and citizen of 1791 as it completely ignored the rights of women
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_6.wav,916210,the jacobin government rejected the demand for equal rights to women and sought to shut down all womens clubs across france olympe de gouges subsequently drafted the declaration of rights for women and citizen in the same year and addressed it to the queen and the national assembly she also criticised the jacobin government for forcibly shutting down all womens clubs
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_7.wav,392926,olympe de gouges was charged with treason and on november 2 1793 she was sentenced to the guillotine by the national convention
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_8.wav,571812,another eminent lady in the history of the french revolution who was guillotined in 1793 was charlotte corday she assassinated jean paul marat the jacobin leader who was also responsible for the reign of terror
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/Deepspeech/data/cmu/women_revolution_9.wav,956334,the revolution carried out by the women of france triggered revolutionary movements in many countries around the world including the international suffrage movement for the next two centuries although french women fought for equal rights since 1789 it was only two centuries later in 1946 that they won the right to exercise their franchise and equal wages
