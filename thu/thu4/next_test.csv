/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_01.wav,647880,a debate is a formal discussion on a particular topic between 2 sides involving many people in front of a public assembly or a panel of judges the two sides offer opposing views and based on the strength and presentation of the argument a particular side is crowned the winner 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_02.wav,289272,the side which speaks for the motion is called the affirmative while the side which speaks against the motion is called negative 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_03.wav,952156,the arguments given in a debate can also be divided into two categories 1 constructive speech the purpose of the constructive speech is to make and support your main arguments in favour of the motion when you are affirmative or against the motion when you are negative for example capital punishment should be banned because death penalty is incompatible with human rights and human dignity 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_04.wav,752370,to rebuttals these arguments are meant to refute the arguments of the opposing side in other words they explain why the opposite sides arguments are weak for example capital punishment should be allowed because this will instil fear in people and prevent people from committing crimes randomly 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_05.wav,360324,things to remember while preparing for debate make a sketch of all the ideas that can be used to argue for or against the given statement 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_06.wav,438066,sequence your ideas well for every argument think of as many examples anecdotes or evidence as you can also think of counter arguments and ways to rebut them 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_07.wav,365340,in this lesson we are going to learn about debate lets watch a video of the 9th grade students of spring valley academy engaged in a debate 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_27.wav,392926,as you saw in this debate the moderator introduces the debate topic which is the proposition for debate proposition means the point being debated 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_28.wav,292616,two sides speak alternately for and against the proposition the two debating sides are called the affirmative and the negative 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_29.wav,333576,affirmative is the side arguing that the proposition is correct and the negative is the side arguing that the proposition is incorrect 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_30.wav,296796,the arguments given in a debate can also be divided into two categories constructive arguments and rebuttals 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_31.wav,642866,the purpose of the constructive argument is to make and support your main arguments in favour of the resolution when you are affirmative or against the resolution when you are negative a constructive argument should be supported by facts and evidences and ought to be persuasive 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_32.wav,708902,for example speaker 1 from the team in favour posits a strong argument for the motion by saying i think that cats make better pets than dogs it is easier to take care of cats take toilet training for example this is constructive argument 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_33.wav,505774,and the purpose of rebuttals is to refute rebuttals are arguments that are meant to invalidate the arguments of the opposing side in other words they explain why the opposite sides arguments are weak 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_34.wav,493236,for example speaker 1 from the opposition rebuts the motion by saying i do not agree that cats are easier to take care of dogs can be toilet trained easily and one does not even need a sand pit 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_35.wav,437230,this process of putting across views/opinions on the proposition goes on for sometime between the two sides then the audience asks questions and the speakers answer 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_36.wav,575992,then speakers from both sides summarise for instance speaker 1 speaking in favour of the proposition summarises as cats make better pets than dogs because they are easier to take care of cheaper and quieter 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_37.wav,352802,while speaker 2 speaking against the proposition concludes cats do not make better pets than dogs because dogs are more loyal and useful 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_38.wav,639522,so what can be deduced from this video is that a debate is a formal discussion on a particular topic between 2 sides involving many people in front of a public assembly or a panel of judges the two sides offer opposing views and argue about a proposition 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_39.wav,262522,now that you have got to know what a debate is here are certain things you need to keep in mind while preparing for it 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_40.wav,575992,firstly you need to have clarity on the topic assigned put across whatever you are arguing for or against in a convincing manner the strength of your content facts evidences in the argument comes from clarity 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_41.wav,764074,and talking about clarity as it is integral to boost your confidence it enhances your presentation during debate presentation includes your temperament intonation body language and confidence level so using a calm assertive tone with proper intonation and pauses while debating carry much conviction 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_42.wav,455620,the next point that you should keep in mind is always be well informed research well beforehand on the topic you are going to speak pre requisite knowledge gives you confidence 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_43.wav,506610,another aspect of debating is organisation of ideas arranging the arguments logically enables crisp and tactful presentation this gives you a logical flow while speaking 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/debate_44.wav,591038,and finally keep in mind the point of persuasion speaking persuasively to win over the audience is the crux of debate depending upon your ability to stand by your stance the power of persuasion is judged during a debate 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_01.wav,509954,i am confused holmes i am reading a medical research paper by a learned colleague but i have some trouble following his train of thought i wish there was some way to identify the connection between the different sentences 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_02.wav,263358,really interesting how did you identify them are they used in all kinds of discourses 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_03.wav,436394,let me try it to begin with marks the opening statement obviously emphasizes his emotion also adds information 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_04.wav,765746,so introduces an effect of a cause first of all puts in sequence for instance gives an example then continues the sequence however indicates contrast so instead indicates another contrast 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_05.wav,868564,by the way changes the subject as luck would have it prepares for bad news apparently suggests the quality of information just like compares to something else so to speak softens up the statement on top of all adds new information 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_06.wav,1020700,you see connects back to the reader finally provides last item in sequence somehow tells us the quality of the action to sum it up marks a concluding statement so i thought prepares us for something more in reality lays ground for contrasting information im afraid prepares for bad news 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/discourse_markers_07.wav,163048,thanks very much do you have a list of discourse markers with you 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_01.wav,218218,here are a few guidelines to remember while giving an eyewitness account of an event 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_02.wav,242460,in this lesson we will learn how to describe someones physical appearance and give an eyewitness account 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_03.wav,258342,now that you ask me i remember there was this orphan boy about my age at that time 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_04.wav,559274,his name was nero because he was born during the great fire under the reign of emperor nero he used to run errands for local merchants for his daily bread he must have been about 16 years old 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_05.wav,943796,he was wearing a light blue toga that was badly worn out and had gaping holes all over he wore a rope around his waist and some kind of amulet around his neck he was barefoot when i met him he was tall for his age about five feet and ten inches he was lean but strong his skin was dark and dry from all the time he spent in the sun 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_06.wav,617788,he had short curly hair on an oval face he had bright black eyes widely set in his face he had a sharp tapering nose and thick cracking lips he had some facial hair along the jaws and under his chin 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_07.wav,295124,even though ill favoured by fate he looked like a fighter and a survivor he would have made a fine soldier 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_08.wav,336920,yes to describe someones physical appearance we can follow this structure with some variations based on personal preferences and judgements 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_09.wav,454784,start with the persons name age and some introductory information then describe the persons dress and accessories worn then describe the build and height of the person 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_10.wav,671286,then describe the persons skin complexion and skin type then describe the persons hair and face then describe the persons eyes nose and lips including special features conclude with your overall impression of the persons appearance 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_11.wav,351130,i am curious to hear what he told you about that evening he gave me an eyewitness account of that days events this is how it went 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_12.wav,297630,yes although the minor details may vary we can still follow these guidelines to ensure a good eyewitness account 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_13.wav,554258,begin with an engaging summary of the event to set the stage provide some context like nero explained the morning tremors and their apparent insignificance proceed with rest of the events in chronological order 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_14.wav,498252,include yourself in the account to make it sound more real describe the objects and people involved in the event at various stages mention the time and place of the various incidents 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_15.wav,375372,describe actions and clearly state their agency that is who did or what caused those actions give probable reasons for observations 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_16.wav,565124,provide relatable images for your observations describe unique things in familiar terms provide sensory descriptions include colours seen sounds heard smells noticed tastes and touches experienced 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/phy_appearance_17.wav,234938,but also comment to capture the mood of the event so lets practice now 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_01.wav,220726,we read different types of texts but we do not read them with the same purpose in mind 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_02.wav,736488,what are the different purposes of reading to gather information to figure out how to do a certain thing instruction to visualise an object place person etc they provide details for the readers to make a mental picture of the same description 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_03.wav,251656,to understand why we should do something persuasion to enjoy pleasure 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_04.wav,184782,in this lesson we are going to learn about understanding the purpose of a text 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_05.wav,209860,we read different types of texts but do we read them with the same purpose in mind 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_06.wav,586858,no texts serve various kinds of purposes why do we read a text sometimes we read for information instruction description persuasion pleasure 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_08.wav,361160,take a look at this here we can see a picture in which some students are reading something on the notice board let us read it carefully 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_09.wav,608592,now that we have finished reading let us answer a few questions which school has displayed the notice rv public school dhanbad what is the notice about it is about a match for selection of the school team for the football tournament 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_10.wav,462306,when is the selection scheduled its scheduled on 7th august 2016 where is the selection match going to happen in the school football playground 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_11.wav,596890,so we see that texts sometimes provide us valuable information in this case information and minute details about date time venue are very important hence it needs to be read very carefully 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_12.wav,462306,this happens when we do not pay attention to what we read that is why one should read the text carefully and give due attention to each and every detail provided to understand the purpose of a given text 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_13.wav,399612,when we read texts on notice boards split flap displays in airports railway stations or in stadiums our purpose to gain information is served 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_14.wav,204844,now lets look at an instance of reading a text with the purpose of getting instructions 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_15.wav,565960,its the leaflet found inside the box of scrabble read the text once so how do we start the game the first player combines two or more of his or her letters to form a word and places them on the board 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_16.wav,247476,what is the next step to be done yes we need to complete our turn by announcing the score 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_17.wav,550078,what is to be done next new letters are to be drawn as many as you played how does the second player take his turn yes correct he adds one or more letters to those already played to form new words 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_18.wav,234102,here the text in this leaflet is serving the purpose of getting instruction and at the same time information 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_19.wav,636178,instruction manuals found like for instance with washing machines/microwaves/mobile phones guidebooks information leaflets handbooks cookbooks road signs are all meant for providing instructions 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_20.wav,163048,reading these carefully may help us complete a task correctly 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_21.wav,168900,now let us look at texts which we read to look for description or persuasion 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_22.wav,341098,we come across a lot of advertisements like this on the billboards sidewalks look at this advertisement that appeared in a newspaper 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_23.wav,265866,what is the advertisement about its about basketball shoes how does the company describe its product 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_24.wav,320200,they say that they are colourful stylish and made of comfortable material so here we see a description of a product 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_25.wav,305154,what are the manufacturers of the product trying to do using this advertisement they are trying to persuade people to buy their product 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_26.wav,499088,why should we buy this particular product we should buy them because the advertisement claims that they are comfortable yet stylish and they come in all 7 basketball team colours so one can buy the colour that represents their favourite team 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_27.wav,249148,so texts on advertisements information leaflets provide us with description information 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_28.wav,398778,advertisements particularly in the process of describing products try to persuade us to think in a particular way about something advertisements are quite persuasive 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_30.wav,411316,we also read for pleasure literary texts are sometimes read for pleasure we read story books novels magazines at our leisure or while travelling 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_31.wav,169736,needless to say that these texts serve the purpose of description as well 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_32.wav,378716,so let us recall what are the different purposes of reading to gather information to figure out how to do a certain thing instruction 
/home/testuser/git-lfs-2.2.0/deepspeech/data/cmu/reading_purpose_33.wav,623640,to visualise an object place person etc they provide details for the readers to make a mental picture of the same description to understand why we should do something persuasion to enjoy pleasure
