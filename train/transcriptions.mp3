<s> In this module, you will learn about the differences between photosynthesis and respiration. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 2 )
<s> Did  you know that the metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration help to maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide on earth? </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 3 )
<s> Let us look at the two processes in a little more detail.  </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 4 )
<s> To begin with, photosynthesis is a process during which plants produce their own food using atmospheric carbon dioxide and energy from  sunlight. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 5 )
<s> On the other hand, respiration is the process of breakdown of complex food molecules to produce energy. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 6 )
<s>  Photosynthesis and respiration are therefore inevitable metabolic processes in green plants, as the former provides food as well as oxygen, whereas the latter produces energy. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 7 )
<s> By comparing the two we can  identify similarities and differences between them. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 8 )
<s> The main similarity between photosynthesis and respiration is that they occur only in living cells. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 9 )
<s> Further, they involve the exchange of gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 10 )
<s> Now, let us look at the differences between photosynthesis and respiration. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 11 )
<s> Photosynthesis is exclusively exhibited by green plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria, while respiration is observed in all living organisms. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 12 )
<s> Also, photosynthesis occurs only in those cells which possess chloroplasts with the pigment chlorophyll. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 13 )
<s> On the other hand, respiration occurs in all  living cells, either in their cytoplasm or mitochondria.  </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 14 )
<s> As far as the processes are concerned, in photosynthesis, simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide and water combine together to release a complex compound, glucose,  by the process of anabolism. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 15 )
<s> Whereas in respiration, the complex compound glucose is broken down into simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide, and water by the process of catabolism. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 16 )
<s> Thus, photosynthesis utilises carbon dioxide and  releases oxygen that all living organisms need to respire, while respiration utilises oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide for organisms which are green to photosynthesise. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 17 )
<s> Next, in terms of energy, light energy is converted into chemical energy and stored during photosynthesis. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 18 )
<s> Whereas in respiration, the chemical energy is partly converted into usable energy for various activities and the rest is converted into heat. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 19 )
<s> Photosynthesis takes place in two steps, namely light reaction and dark reaction. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 20 )
<s> In the light reaction, sunlight is used to form oxygen and the energy sources namely, Adenosine Triphosphate or ATP and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate or NADPH.  </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 21 )
<s> In the dark reaction, the carbon dioxide is converted into glucose using energy sources. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 22 )
<s> On the other hand, respiration takes place in three steps, namely glycolysis, Krebs' Cycle and electron transport. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 23 )
<s> Glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose in the cytoplasm. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 24 )
<s> Then, the end products produced in glycolysis are moved from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion in Krebs' Cycle, which involves the production of energy sources such as NADH or Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, FADH2 or Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 25 )
<s> Lastly, electron transport involves the generation of ATP from these energy sources. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 26 )
<s> The next difference between photosynthesis and respiration is that all photosynthetic reactions utilise energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. Hence, it is an endothermic reaction. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 27 )
<s> While in respiration, energy is released in the form of ATP, and hence it’s an exothermic reaction. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 28 )
<s> Next, photosynthesis is of three types, namely C3, C4 and CAM, based on which plants synthesise carbohydrates. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 29 )
<s> While, respiration is of two types, namely aerobic and anaerobic. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 30 )
<s> Let us look at the next difference between photosynthesis and respiration. In photosynthesis, there is a gain in dry weight of the plant due to the synthesis of food which is accumulated in the plant. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 31 )
<s> However, in respiration, there is a loss of dry weight of the plant due to the breakdown of food and the escape of carbon dioxide formed. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 32 )
<s> We shall now look at the differences between the factors affecting the two processes. The factors affecting photosynthesis are concentration of carbon dioxide, intensity of temperature and water availability. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 33 )
<s> On the other hand, the factors affecting respiration are concentration of oxygen, glucose and ATP. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 34 )
<s> Another difference between photosynthesis and respiration is that the former takes place only in the presence of light, while the latter occurs at all times. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 35 )
<s> Next, the rate of photosynthetic activity is more during mid-day as the plants are exposed to bright sunlight during noon. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 36 )
<s> At this time, since the intensity of light is high, the uptake of carbon dioxide is also high followed by greater amount of oxygen release. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 37 )
<s> The rate of respiration fluctuates as per the amount of the energy required. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 38 )
<s>  We have now learnt about some major differences between the two metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration. </s> (train Bio_Respiration_Photosynthesis versus Respiration 39 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about the World Health Organisation or W-H-O. </s> (train ICSE_10_Health Organisations_World Health Organisation_IDER 2 )
<s> Did you know that the polio vaccine was available even several decades ago?  </s> (train ICSE_10_Health Organisations_World Health Organisation_IDER 3 )
<s> However, it is only during the last fifteen years that the disease has been brought under control. </s> (train ICSE_10_Health Organisations_World Health Organisation_IDER 4 )
<s> This has been possible due to the extensive immunisation campaigns organised by the WHO.  Since nineteen eighty eight, the number of polio cases has decreased by more than ninety nine per cent. </s> (train ICSE_10_Health Organisations_World Health Organisation_IDER 5 )

<s> In addition, to prevent the spread of epidemic diseases, the WHO frames health regulations for people travelling to another country. </s> (train ICSE_10_Health Organisations_World Health Organisation_IDER 32 )
<s> Thus, the WHO plays a vital role in maintaining the health of people all over the world. </s> (train ICSE_10_Health Organisations_World Health Organisation_IDER 33 )
<s> Food provides us with the energy to carry out life processes, which include nutrition - consuming the food and digesting it, respiration - deriving energy from it, excretion - removing the waste from the body, and responding to the environmental stimuli. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 4 )
<s> Among these life processes, the basic process, that is nutrition further includes procuring the food, absorbing the nutrients and utilising them in the body. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 5 )
<s> Nutrition is of two types, namely, autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic nutrition.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 6 )
<s> Autotrophic mode of nutrition is exhibited by green plants by the process of photosynthesis. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 7 )
<s> While heterotrophic mode of nutrition is exhibited by all animals including humans and non-green plants.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 8 )
<s> Nutrition in animals is a complex process, which occurs in five basic steps, namely, ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation and egestion. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 9 )
<s> All the processes involved in nutrition in human beings take place in the various digestive organs, which together formsthe digestive system. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 10 )
<s> The process by which an organism consumes or takes in  food is called ingestion.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 11 )
<s> Different living organisms ingest  food in different ways.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 12 )
<s> For example, we eat food through our mouth. Hence, the mouth is the body part where ingestion takes place in human beings.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 13 )
<s> The next step in nutrition is digestion. The process in which complex insoluble substances in the food are split into simpler soluble molecules is called digestion. These simple soluble substances are also called nutrients. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 14 )
<s> The digestive enzymes break down the complex food molecules, such as... </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 18 )
<s> .... carbohydrates into simpler sugar units, proteins into amino acids, and fats into glycerol and fatty acids respectively.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 19 )
<s> The next step in nutrition is absorption. It is the process in which nutrients formed as a result of digestion are absorbed from the digestive tract into the blood vessels and lymph vessels.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 20 )
<s> The blood vessels absorb nutrients such as simple sugar units, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and even water molecules from the digestive tract, and distribute the same to different parts of the body through blood. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 21 )
<s> The lymph vessels, on the other hand, absorb fatty acids from the digestive tract and distribute the same to all parts of the body through the lymph. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 22 )
<s> "
The maximum absorption of nutrients takes place within the small intestine." </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 23 )
<s> Do you know that in lower organisms such as amoeba, the food molecules are ingested and digested within the vesicles? Thereafter, the nutrients produced in the vesicles are directly absorbed into the protoplasm. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 24 )
<s> "After absorption, the next step in nutrition is assimilation. The process in which the absorbed nutrients are utilised by the tissues and cells of the body for growth, repair and for energy generation is called assimilation.
" </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 25 )
<s> The cells take in the required nutrients from the blood or lymph and assimilate them in the body. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 26 )
<s> The final step in nutrition is egestion. It is the process of eliminating the undigested food in the form of faeces from the body through the large intestine and anus.   </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 27 )
<s> Once the soluble molecules are absorbed from the small intestine, the left out undigested food enters into the large intestine.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 28 )
<s> When the undigested food moves through the large intestine, water is reabsorbed, and the waste is expelled through the anus in the form of faeces. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 29 )
<s> Hence, we can conclude that the steps in nutrition, namely ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation and egestion are required for the growth and survival of  living organisms. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_7_Life Processes_Steps in Nutrition 30 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about protein energy malnutrition. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 2 )
<s> Did you know that globally one out of  twelve children exhibits stunted growth and is underweight? </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 3 )
<s> This number adds up to around fifty-two million children across the world. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 4 )
<s> The reason behind this situation is that these children do not have access to a balanced diet and hence become victims of malnutrition. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 5 )
<s> Malnutrition is an abnormality caused due to inadequate intake, non-absorption or non-utilisation of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals by the body, which are required for proper growth and maintenance of health. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 6 )
<s> For instance, protein energy malnutrition results from a diet that provides inadequate amount of protein and energy .  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 7 )
<s> Proteins are required for the growth and repair of damaged body tissues, while energy is required to carry out  various metabolic and daily activities.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 8 )
<s> Since the deficiencies of proteins and energy go hand in hand, their deficiency is known as  protein energy malnutrition or PEM, or protein calorie malnutrition or PCM. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 9 )
<s> PEM occurs across all age groups but is more prevalent in children. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 10 )
<s> The two common forms of PEM are kwashiorkor and marasmus. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 11 )
<s> Kwashiorkor is caused by severe protein deficiency seen in infants who are around twelve months old.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 12 )
<s> This protein deficiency occurs mainly due to immediate pregnancy and delivery of the second child, wherein the mother, breast feeds the second child,…. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 13 )
<s> …and substitutes  breast milk with starchy food for the first child. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 14 )
<s> As a result, the starch rich diet fed to the first child gives energy but provides inadequate amount of  proteins. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 15 )
<s> The occurrence of this condition is the main reason behind naming it as kwashiorkor, which means “the disease the first child gets when the second one is born” in the  Ga language, spoken in Ghana. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 16 )
<s> Although kwashiorkor is more prevalent in infants below twelve months of age,  it can also affect children between upto three years of age, if their daily intake of protein is less. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 17 )
<s> Children affected by Kwashiorkor exhibit certain typical symptoms related to body structure, facial characteristics and brain development. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 18 )
<s> As far as body structure is concerned, the child exhibits stunted growth, and the legs become very thin and curved. The stomach becomes swollen..... </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 19 )
<s> ...... due to the retention of water by the cells, and this condition is called oedema. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 20 )
<s> Coming to facial characteristics, the eyes appear bulged, skin gets scaly and peels off, and hair becomes reddish before the age of five. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 21 )
<s> Furthermore, because deficiency of proteins and energy, affects the structural and functional development of the brain, the affected children show mild to low mental and behavioural development. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 22 )
<s> In extreme cases, kwashiorkor can be fatal if  timely treatment is not given. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 23 )
<s> As a control measure for Kwashiorkor, a mother should have a gap of two to three years between pregnancies, so that she can breast-feed the child at least for a year. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 24 )
<s> The affected children can be treated by providing them with a protein-rich diet which should include more than one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 25 )
<s> Protein-rich diet may include a combination of wheat, gram, soya beans, peanuts and jaggery. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 26 )
<s> Now, let us look at another type of PEM called marasmus, which occurs due to inadequate intake of food; in other words starvation.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 28 )
<s> This is because people below the poverty line cannot afford a basic meal a day for their children. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 30 )
<s> At the same time, since there is a deficiency of proteins, the tissue proteins are used up for producing energy in the body.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 31 )
<s> This process of the body breaking down its own tissue to synthesise energy is known as muscle wasting. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 32 )
<s> This concept is the reason behind naming this condition as marasmus which is derived form the Greek word 'marasmos', meaning withering or wasting. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 33 )
<s> The symptoms of marasmus include a weak body with loose skin and bones, with the ribs visible. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 34 )
<s> The absence of the fatty layer beneath the skin of the affected child, makes it wrinkled and gives the body a shrivelled appearance. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 35 )
<s> Other characteristics of children affected by marasmus include pale eyes, and a face which looks bigger than the rest of the body. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 36 )
<s> In addition, due to a weakened immune system, the body is also  prone to infectious diseases. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 37 )
<s> On the whole, the affected child appears dull and is both physically and mentally retarded. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 38 )
<s> The preventive and control measures for marasmus are the same as that for kwashiorkor, that is, to provide the child with a balanced protein-rich diet. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 39 )
<s> Thus, we have looked into protein energy malnutrition and the two common types of PEM - kwashiorkor and marasmus, and the measures that help to control these deficiencies. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_9_Nutrition_Protein Energy Malnutrition_IDER 40 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about the differences between diffusion and osmosis. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 2 )
<s> What happens if you add a pinch of food colour into a beaker containing water? The food colour spreads  through water and imparts its colour to the water.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 3 )
<s> Now, take a dialysis tubing, seal it at one end,  fill it with water and add food colour to the water. Then, seal the other end of the dialysis tube also, and drop it into a beaker containing water. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 4 )
<s> You will observe that the dialysis tubing bulges in size.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 5 )
<s> So, what do these two activities indicate? Both of them involve the movement of some molecules. But, what is the difference between the two phenomena?  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 6 )
<s> In the first case, there is movement of solute molecules, that is food colour, from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This process is called diffusion. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 7 )
<s> In the second case, there is movement of solvent molecules, that is, water, from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration of solvent, or  from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration of solute, through a semi-permeable membrane. This process is called osmosis.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 8 )
<s> Now, let us further see how both diffusion and osmosis vary from each other in terms of the media they occur in, the role of the semi-permeable membrane, if any, the pace of the process, requirement of energy and the distance travelled by the molecules. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 9 )
<s> To begin with, diffusion can occur in all types of media such as liquids and gases.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 10 )
<s> For instance, diffusion of liquid in liquid medium occurs when ink is dropped into water; diffusion of solid in liquid medium is seen in the case of sugar cube and water; diffusion of liquid in gas medium is seen when perfume is sprayed in the air and diffusion of solid in gas medium is seen when dust particles disperse in air.    </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 11 )
<s> On the other hand, as seen with the dialysis tubing, osmosis occurs only in a liquid medium.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 12 )
<s> Diffusion involves the direct movement of molecules across different media without the requirement of any membrane, while osmosis occurs only through a semi-permeable membrane.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 13 )
<s> With respect to the pace of the processes, diffusion is rapid in gases and slow in the case of liquids.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 14 )
<s> ...while osmosis, in general, is a very slow process.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 15 )
<s> As far as energy is concerned, diffusion does not involve any energy expenditure, while osmosis requires energy to push the solvent molecules across the semi-permeable membrane. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 16 )
<s> Lastly, in terms of the distance travelled by the molecules, it is observed that in diffusion, gas, liquid or solid molecules diffuse over long distances.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 17 )
<s> On the other hand, the molecules moving through osmosis are transported only up to a short distance. </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 18 )
<s> Thus, we have looked into the differences between the processes of diffusion and osmosis.  </s> (train ICSE_Goyal_10_Differences between diffusion and osmosis_IDER 19 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about cell theory. </s> (train ICSE Selina_9_Cell - The Unit Of Life_Cell Theory 2 )

<s> In this module, you will learn about the types of blood vessels. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 2 )
<s> Blood vessels are branched tubes, which carry blood from and to the heart in the body. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 3 )
<s> They carry vital nutrients and oxygen to all the cells of the body. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 5 )
<s> Apart from carrying nutrients and oxygen, they also drive unwanted materials like carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes towards the excretory organs such as lungs and kidneys, respectively. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 6 )
<s> Blood vessels are of three types-arteries, veins and capillaries. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 7 )
<s> Arteries are those blood vessels which carry blood away from the heart to the various organs of the body. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 9 )
<s> All arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart, except for the pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for purification.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 10 )
<s> The three main characteristics of arteries are that they have thick muscular walls, a narrow lumen and blood flowing in spurts. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 11 )
<s> Arteries have thick muscular walls to withstand the force exerted by the oxygenated blood when flushed out from the heart. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 12 )
<s> A narrow space inside the arteries, called the lumen, is able to maintain the blood at a high pressure with which it is supplied to the organs. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 13 )
<s> Lastly, blood in the arteries flows in spurts which enables the blood to flow in one direction, since arteries do not have any valves to control the flow. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 14 )
<s> This flow of blood in spurts is due to the ventricular contractions of the heart.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 15 )
<s> Due to the flow of blood at high pressure inside the arteries, they are located deep under the skin . </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 16 )
<s> Let us now deal with the second type of blood vessels, the veins.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 17 )
<s> Veins are those blood vessels, which collect blood from the various organs of the body and bring it back to the heart. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 18 )
<s> All  veins carry deoxygenated blood from the organs, except for the pulmonary vein which carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 19 )
<s> The four main characteristics of veins are that they have thin and less muscular walls, a wider lumen, the presence of semilunar valves, and the smooth flow of blood. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 20 )
<s> Veins have thin and less muscular walls as blood flows through them with less speed and at low pressure. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 21 )
<s> As the walls are thin and less elastic, veins have a wider lumen so as to carry all the deoxygenated blood from different organs of the body towards the heart. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 22 )
<s> Further, veins have semilunar valves that allow the blood to flow in only one direction, preventing the backflow of blood. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 23 )
<s> These semilunar valves get opened by the force of the blood flowing from the organs towards the heart. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 24 )
<s> As far as the location is concerned, due to the flow of blood at low pressure inside the veins, they are located superficially under the skin. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 25 )
<s> We shall now look into the third type of blood vessels-- the capillaries. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 26 )
<s> Capillaries are microscopic vessels formed by the further branching of arterioles, which are the finer branches of arteries. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 27 )
<s> Capillaries are made up of a single layer of squamous epithelial cells. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 28 )
<s> The main function of capillaries is to carry oxygenated blood from the arterioles to the surrounding tissues. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 29 )
<s> In the tissue, there is an exchange of nutrients and oxygen with nitrogenous wastes and carbon dioxide through the single layer of capillaries. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 30 )
<s> The lumen of the capillary is very thin as compared to that of the artery. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 31 )
<s> Numerous capillaries from the tissue unite to form common branches called venules, which further unite to form a larger vein. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 32 )
<s> The wall of the capillaries is made up of single layer of cells, hence making it thinner to facilitate exchange of materials in the tissues. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 33 )
<s> Let us now look at some additional features of arteries, veins and capillaries. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 34 )
<s> With regards to the anatomy of the blood vessels, both arteries and veins have walls made up of three concentric layers. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 35 )
<s> These three concentric layers are the inner ‘tunica interna’, middle ‘tunica media’ and the outermost ‘tunica externa’. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 36 )
<s> 'Tunica interna' is made up of flat endothelial cells.This layer is internally lined by an elastic membrane, which reduces the friction between the blood and the walls.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 37 )
<s> Next, 'tunica media' is made up of smooth, non-striated muscle fibres and elastic connective tissue, which is responsible for contraction and dilation of blood vessels.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 38 )
<s> These smooth muscles are responsible for vasoconstriction and vasodilation of blood vessels.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 39 )
<s> Lastly, 'tunica externa' is made up of loosely arranged elastic collagen fibres, which protects arteries from external pressure. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 40 )
<s> It must be remembered that though arteries and veins have similar structures in their walls, the thick walls of arteries are well–developed with elastic connective tissue. This makes them non-collapsible. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 41 )
<s> On the contrary, the thin walls of the veins are loosely arranged collagen fibres, which make them collapsible. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 42 )
<s> Next, an additional feature of blood vessels, especially arteries is that they can contract or dilate. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 43 )
<s> The contraction of a blood vessel to decrease the blood supply to a particular part of the body is called vasoconstriction. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 44 )
<s> On the other hand, the dilation of the blood vessel to increase the blood supply to a particular part of the body is called vasodilation. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 45 )
<s> Thus, each type of blood vessel with its specific structure and characteristics plays a significant role in circulating blood to all parts of the body. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_Bio_The Circulatory System_Blood Vessels 46 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about acid rain. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 2 )
<s> Look at the two images of Taj Mahal. Do you know what is responsible for the corrosion of this 'Wonder of the World'?  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 3 )
<s> It is 'acid rain'. So, what is acid rain? </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 4 )
<s> Acid rain refers to the deposition of acidic components from the atmosphere on to the Earth in the form of rain, snow, dew, fog, gases or atmospheric particles. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 5 )
<s> Let us now see where  the acid rain picks up the acidic components from. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 6 )
<s> Industries, power stations and vehicles generate oxides of sulphur, such as sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide, and oxides of nitrogen such as nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 7 )
<s> These gases linger in the atmosphere as gaseous pollutants and cause air pollution.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 8 )
<s> Moreover, the highly reactive oxides of sulphur and nitrogen combine with water droplets to form sulphuric and nitric acids respectively.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 9 )
<s> On the other hand, oxides of sulphur and nitrogen can also react with metals to form metal sulphates and metal nitrates. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 10 )
<s> Further, these metal sulphates and metal nitrates combine with water to form sulphuric and nitric acids respectively.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 11 )
<s> These chemicals come down to earth as acid rain in two forms, namely wet deposition and dry deposition. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 12 )
<s> Wet deposition is the acidic water that is formed when the acids combine with water. They can be in the form of rain, snow, dew, or fog. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 13 )
<s> We can determine the acidity of rain by considering its pH value. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 14 )
<s> Interestingly, unpolluted rain water is also found to be slightly acidic, having a pH of about 5 to 6. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 15 )
<s> The unpolluted rain water is acidic because of the carbon dioxide in the air, which combines with water and forms a weak acid.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 16 )
<s> This slightly acidic rain water turns into acid rain when it combines with gaseous pollutants and forms highly concentrated acids. The pH of this rain water decreases to 4. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 17 )
<s> As far as dry deposition is concerned, it takes place through acidic wind that is formed by the combination of acidic gases like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, and acidic particles like metal nitrates and metal sulphates.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 18 )
<s> Dry deposits get accumulated on the surfaces of tall trees and large buildings. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 19 )
<s> During rain, these dry deposits combine with water and get washed down as acid rain.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 20 )
<s> Let us now see how acid rain has an effect on almost all the aspects of the environment. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 21 )
<s> Acid rain is harmful to human beings, animals, plants, microorganisms, aquatic beings, soil, water resources, monuments, metals,  etc. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 22 )
<s> For instance, long term exposure to acid rain drenches  plants and may burn them completely.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 23 )
<s> Exposure to acid rain for a while affects the enzymatic activity in plants and leads to their wilting.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 24 )
<s> Acid rain also leads to increased mortality of seedlings. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 25 )
<s> Apart from plants, humans who get directly exposed to high concentration of acid rain  get burns on their skin.  In animals, it can even cause death. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 26 )
<s>  Acid rain with low concentration of acids   causes severe irritation of skin and burning sensation of  eyes in both animals and humans. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 27 )
<s> Let us now see how  acid rain affects  soil microorganisms. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 28 )
<s> Acid rain reduces the respiratory rate of soil microorganisms like bacteria, thereby slowing down the decomposition process in the forest floor. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 29 )
<s> Further, acid rain also makes the fungi vulnerable to diseasecausing pathogens by damaging their protective layer called cuticle, and other features, which in turn affects the forest floor’s decomposition process. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 30 )
<s> In addition, it also causes a decline in the number of nitrogen-fixing algae in the soil, which further affects plant growth.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 31 )
<s> As far as aquatic animals are concerned, acid rain is poisonous to them since it directly dumps acids into water resources making them more acidic.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 32 )
<s> Aquatic organisms such as zooplanktons and smaller invertebrates such as snails also face destruction due to  acid rain.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 33 )
<s> Let us now look at how acid rain affects the soil. Acid rain makes the soil acidic.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 34 )
<s> This gradually reduces its fertility, thus affecting crops and forests growing in it. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 35 )
<s> Acid rain also causes the release of toxic chemicals such as aluminium and mercury into the soil, making it unfit for the survival of plants. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 36 )
<s> Potable water resources become poisonous due to acid rain. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 37 )
<s> Have you ever heard of stone cancer caused by acid rain? We are aware of the fact that marble is mainly composed of calcium carbonate. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 38 )
<s> This calcium carbonate  reacts with acids in the rain and corrodes the marble, thus resulting in  stone cancer.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 39 )
<s> Stone cancer damages the marble-made historic monuments to a great extent and  leads to their discolouration . </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 40 )
<s> Likewise, metal objects that get exposed to acid rain undergo corrosion and also lose their lustre.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_Pollution_Acid Rain 41 )

<s> In this module, you will learn about the differences between arteries and veins. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 2 )
<s> You will see that the pipes that supply clean drinking water are separate from the pipes that carry sewage water. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 4 )
<s> Similarly, our body has one type of blood vessels carrying pure blood, and another type carrying impure blood. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 5 )
<s> The blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart into the various organs of the body are called arteries. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 6 )
<s> On the other hand, the blood vessels that collect deoxygenated blood from the various organs of the body and bring it back to the heart are called veins. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 7 )
<s> There are many differences between arteries and veins. Let us look at them.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 8 )
<s> Do you know arteries branch into small arterioles, which further branch into smaller capillaries? </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 9 )
<s> The capillaries then combine to form smaller structures called venules, which in turn collate to increase in size, and then form veins. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 10 )
<s> Thus, arteries branch progressively, decreasing in size, while veins unite progressively, increasing in size.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 11 )
<s> As far as the location of arteries and veins is concerned, the arteries are deep-seated inside the body, while the veins are superficially located, near the skin. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 12 )
<s>  Next, with respect to the nature of blood transported, all the arteries, except for the pulmonary artery, circulate pure blood. On the other hand, all the veins, except for the pulmonary vein, transport impure blood. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 13 )
<s> In view of direction of blood flow, arteries transport blood from the heart to all the organs, while veins transport vice-versa.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 14 )
<s> Let us now consider the colour of arteries and veins. Arteries are bright red in colour as they carry oxygen-rich blood, whereas veins are dark red, as they carry blood deficient in oxygen. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 15 )
<s> We shall now look into some major structural differences between arteries and veins.   </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 16 )
<s> To begin with, the walls of arteries are thick, muscular and highly elastic, while those of the veins are thin, less muscular and not as elastic as the walls of arteries.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 17 )
<s> In addition, the muscularity determines the nature of the walls of arteries and veins.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 18 )
<s> The walls of the arteries are non-collapsible due to the well-developed musculature, whereas the walls in veins are collapsible  due to the lack of well-developed muscles. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 19 )
<s> Further, the walls of arteries and veins are made up of three concentric layers called 'tunica externa', 'tunica media' and 'tunica interna'.   </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 20 )
<s> Arteries have well developed 'tunica media', but lesser developed 'tunica externa'. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 21 )
<s> On the other hand, veins have comparatively less developed 'tunica media' but well-developed 'tunica externa'.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 22 )
<s> In the context of special structures present inside, arteries do not have any valves to regulate the flow of blood, while veins possess valves to regulate the flow of blood as well as to prevent the backward flow of blood. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 23 )
<s> Next, if we compare the lumina, arteries have quite a narrow lumen, while veins have a wide lumen. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 24 )
<s> Since the lumen of the artery is narrow, blood flows at a high speed and under great pressure, whereas it flows slowly and with low pressure in veins. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 25 )
<s> Additionally, arteries exhibit the features of constriction and dilation to control blood flow. Veins do exhibit dilation, but not constriction. </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 26 )
<s> Thus, we have looked at some of the major differences between arteries and veins.  </s> (train ICSE Selina_10_The Circulatory System_Differences Between Arteries and Veins 27 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about the role of kidneys in osmoregulation. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 2 )
<s> Do you know that kidneys filter the blood in the human body around four hundred times a day, and excrete thousand to two thousand millilitres of urine?  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 3 )
<s> Kidneys are the excretory organs that play a major role in filtering blood and removing excess water and nitrogenous wastes from it in the form of urine.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 4 )
<s> The kidneys, while removing wastes from the blood, also regulate the percentage of water and salts in it.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 5 )
<s> This process of regulating the concentration of water and salts in the body fluids and also maintaining optimum osmotic pressure is called osmoregulation. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 6 )
<s> The word osmoregulation was coined by the scientist Rudolf Hober in the year 1902. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 7 )
<s> Osmoregulation is usually undertaken by the excretory organs, such as nephridia, contractile vacuoles and malphigian tubules in invertebrates, and by kidneys in vertebrates. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 8 )
<s> To understand osmoregulation, let us first understand how water enters the body. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 9 )
<s> The body obtains its water from the food and drinks consumed in a day, and this water gets assimilated into the blood. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 10 )
<s> Thus, the water gets circulated throughout the body along with the blood. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 11 )
<s> When blood is filtered by the functional units of the kidney called nephrons, the excess water present in it is excreted in the form of urine. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 12 )
<s> Let us now learn how water levels are regulated in the blood through osmoregulation during times of low or high amount of water in the blood. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 13 )
<s> During summer, body loses water in the form of sweat, leading to less amount of water in the blood. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 14 )
<s> The low amount of water in the blood is sensed by the osmoregulators of the brain that in turn signals the pituitary gland to secrete the antidiuretic hormone, also known as ADH. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 15 )
<s> ADH binds to the receptors on the collecting duct of the nephron.....  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 17 )
<s> …..it triggers the reabsorption of water from the nephrons into the blood, allowing less loss of water in the form of urine. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 18 )
<s> This makes the urine concentrated and is called hypertonic urine. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 19 )
<s> This is the reason why an individual urinates less during summer. It prevents the individual from getting dehydrated. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 21 )
<s> On the other hand, during winter, the body does not sweat and there is more water in the blood.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 22 )
<s> This excess amount of water in the blood is sensed by osmoregulators. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 23 )
<s> It signals the brain to inhibit the secretion of ADH from the pituitary gland. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 24 )
<s> As a result, when the blood with more water passes through the nephrons, the water is not reabsorbed into the blood.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 25 )

<s> In addition to the regulation of water levels in the body through osmoregulation, let us now understand the gain and loss of water in the human body. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 34 )
<s> On an average, the daily gain and loss of water in a healthy adult at rest in temperate climate are in equilibrium. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 35 )
<s> However, the inflow and outflow of water varies with the climate and lifestyle of people living in different regions. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 36 )
<s> Interestingly, an adult human body contains about forty litres of water, which forms sixty per cent of the body weight.  </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 37 )
<s> Let us now take a look at the different foods and activities that balance the inflow and outflow of water. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 38 )
<s> A normal adult human body gains two thousand five hundred millilitres of water everyday in different ways, like one thousand five hundred millilitres through drinking water and beverages accounting for sixty per cent, and seven hundred millilitres through food, accounting for twenty-five per cent. </s> (train ICSE_Selina_10_The Excretory System_Role of Kidney in Osmoregulation_IDER 39 )

<s> ......... carried off to distant places by agents such as wind, water, animals and birds.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 6 )
<s> In some cases, the pods burst open and the seeds get dispersed to distant places. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 7 )
<s> The chances of germination of these seeds are very less because they are scattered over long distances and may not have favourable conditions to grow. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 8 )
<s> If some seeds happen to germinate, the seedlings again depend on nature for nutrition. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 9 )
<s> The remains of dead animals, plant wastes, and droppings of animals all get buried in the soil and gradually transform into manure. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 10 )
<s> The seedlings depend on this manure, which is the only source of nutrients for them to survive and grow into a complete plant.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 11 )
<s> Furthermore, rain is the only source of water for these plants.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 12 )
<s> Our ancestors must have observed this phenomenon, which is why they started producing new plants by way of seeds.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 13 )
<s> Initially, man collected seeds and raised new plants with the intention of procuring food for himself. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 14 )
<s> In addition, he started domesticating animals such as cow, buffalo, sheep and poultry to obtain food and raw materials.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 15 )
<s> This practice of cultivating plants for food and rearing of animals to obtain meat, milk, eggs and other products is called agriculture. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 16 )
<s> As a part of the development of agriculture, man cleared forests and brought more land under cultivation. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 17 )
<s> He started growing a single type of plant over a large area, and called the plant as crop.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 18 )
<s> The crops that were cultivated included almost all edible plants such as rice, wheat, jowar, gram, groundnut, mustard, citrus fruits and green vegetables as food crops, ..... </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 19 )
<s> ... and plants such as Sudan grass, Rhodes grass and Berseem grass as fodder crops to feed the domesticated animals.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 20 )
<s> Today, agriculture involves cultivation of important crops through scientific methods, known as agricultural practices, to ensure a quality production.   </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 21 )
<s> In fact, farmers take the responsibility of raising new plants and nurturing them at every step in order to obtain a good yield. </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 22 )
<s> This is why cultivation of plants through agriculture ensures consistency and a proper yield of crops.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 23 )
<s> Thus, we have learned how man started and developed the practice of agriculture.  </s> (train MH_9_Quality Food, Quality Life_Agriculture_IDER 24 )
<s> You will feel weak, tired and unable to perform any work. So, is there a relationship between eating food and doing work? </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 4 )
<s> Certainly, a relation can be drawn between both, as you can work energetically only when you eat food regularly. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 5 )
<s> So, what is food? Food is any edible substance, which provides nutrition to maintain life and growth. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 6 )
<s> The process by which our body obtains food and utilises it for growth and development is called nutrition.  </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 7 )
<s> Nutrition aids in availing a variety of nutrients. Nutrients are the chemical substances present in food required for growth and good health.    </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 8 )
<s> The nutrients required by our body are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 9 )
<s> First, let us take the case of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide instant energy required by the body to perform work, and are therefore termed as instant energy sources. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 10 )
<s> Second comes fats which are stored in the body for future use as they yield more energy compared to other nutrients, and are hence termed as high energy reserves. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 11 )
<s> Next comes proteins that aid in growth and repair of worn-out body parts, and hence are called building blocks of the body. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 12 )
<s> Lastly, vitamins and minerals provide resistance against diseases, and are hence considered to be protective substances. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 13 )
<s> Thus, based on the type of nutrients present, food can be classified into energy-giving food, which includes carbohydrates and fats; body-building food, which includes proteins, and finally protective food, which includes vitamins and minerals. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 14 )
<s> Carbohydrates, fats and proteins make up a large portion of our diet and are called macronutrients, while vitamins and minerals occupy a small portion of our diet and are called micronutrients. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 15 )
<s> Both macronutrients and micronutrients, provided by food, are utilised by the cells, which are fundamental units of all the organs in the body. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 16 )
<s> Inside the cells, these nutrients are oxidised to release energy.  </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 17 )
<s> Then this energy is utilised to perform various metabolic activities of the cell and that of the organism as a whole. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 18 )
<s> As far as energy is concerned, do we need energy while sleeping and resting? </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 19 )
<s> We indeed require energy while sleeping and resting, as our body needs to perform the basic metabolic activities such as respiration and circulation in that state as well. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 20 )
<s> Apart from respiration and circulation, metabolic activities that occur in our body include digestion, excretion, growth, reproduction and so on, which are conducted by various organ systems. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 21 )
<s> Human beings generally eat food three times a day at periodic intervals.  The first meal of the day is breakfast in the morning, followed by lunch in the afternoon and finally dinner at night.  </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 22 )
<s> With regards to availability of food, it can be obtained from both plant and animal sources. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 23 )
<s> The food provided by plants is called plant food, while the food provided by animals is called animal food. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 24 )
<s> Thus, food is a nutritious substance, obtained from plant and animal sources,  that is required for the proper functioning of the body. </s> (train MP_7_Biotic Activities of Man_Food 25 )
<s> In this module, you will learn about diarrhoea and enteritis. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 2 )
<s> Do you know that in many countries, including India, four-fifths of all illnesses are those that are spread through contaminated water?  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 3 )
<s> Diarrhoea and enteritis are two such common diseases that spread through contaminated food and water.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 4 )
<s> One way by which food gets contaminated is through houseflies, which feed on contaminated waste, and later sit on foodstuffs, thereby contaminating them also. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 5 )
<s> When someone eats such contaminated food, he or she may get infected. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 6 )
<s> Let us now learn about the causes, symptoms, treatment and preventive measures for diarrhoea and enteritis. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 7 )
<s> Do you know that in United States, adults experience an average of one episode of  Diarrhoea per year, while children have an average of two per year. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 8 )
<s> Diarrhoea is a condition in which the patient suffers from frequent bowel movements with loose watery stools. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 9 )
<s> Diarrhoea can be of two types, namely acute diarrhoea, which lasts for less than two weeks, and chronic diarrhoea, which lasts for more than four weeks. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 10 )
<s> Acute diarrhoea is caused by microorganisms like viruses such as rotavirus, bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and protozoans such as Giardia lamblia, which contaminate food and water.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 11 )
<s> It can also be caused due to intolerance of the digestive system to food items containing gluten or lactose. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 12 )
<s> On the other hand, chronic diarrhoea is caused by inflammation or ulcers in the small intestine or large intestine. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 13 )
<s> An example of chronic diarrhoea is irritable bowel syndrome,  a condition in which there is the contraction and relaxation of intestinal muscles more often causing gas, bloating and diarrhoea. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 14 )
<s> The symptoms of diarrhoea include frequent passing of loose watery stools three or more times a day, abdominal pain and cramps, bloating, vomiting and dehydration. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 15 )
<s> Let us now learn about the other disease called enteritis, caused by consuming contaminated food and water.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 16 )
<s> ‘Enteritis’ is derived from two words ‘enteron’, which means intestine, and ‘itis’, which means inflammation.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 17 )
<s> Thus, enteritis is the inflammation of the inner lining of the small intestine.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 18 )
<s> However, sometimes the inflammation includes even the inner linings of the stomach and large intestine. Therefore, the disease is commonly called gastroenteritis. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 19 )
<s> Enteritis is mainly caused by consuming food and water contaminated with bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 20 )
<s> Even toxins called enterotoxins secreted by some bacteria such as Escherichia coli, cause enteritis.   </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 21 )
<s> However, it is also caused by infection due to viruses such as norovirus and adenovirus,;protozoans such as Entamoeba histolytica; and nematodes such as hookworms.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 22 )
<s> Enteritis caused by Entamoeba histolytica is called Amoebiasis or Amoebic dysentery. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 23 )
<s> Even ingestion of chemicals such as lead and antibiotics can trigger enteritis. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 24 )
<s> As these infectious agents interfere with the absorption of water by the intestine, the patient may suffer from symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 25 )
<s> Amoebiasis involves symptoms such as discharge of sticky fluid and blood along with loose motions. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 26 )
<s> Since the intestinal lining is infected in enteritis, the patient experiences abdominal pain and cramps.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 27 )
<s> The patient also loses appetite. All these factors generally lead to weight loss.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 28 )
<s> Many patients also experience fever during enteritis due to the infection. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 29 )
<s> Both diarrhoea and enteritis lead to the loss of large amount of water from the body, which in turn causes a serious health risk of dehydration. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 30 )
<s> Due to dehydration, the patient might also show additional symptoms like dry mouth and lips, pale face, sunken eyes, excessive thirst, headache, dry skin, fatigue, sunken abdomen and less urination.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 31 )
<s> The patient may also suffer from cold hands and feet as well as a slow pulse rate. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 32 )
<s> In both diarrhoea and enteritis, the patient should seek immediate medical help if the symptoms are noticed for more than a day.     </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 33 )
<s> Since most of the symptoms of diarrhoea and enteritis are caused by dehydration, the loss of electrolytes in the body due to dehydration needs to be addressed.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 35 )
<s> Thus, the patient is given Oral Rehydration Solution or ORS to restore the water and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and chloride lost from the body.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 36 )
<s> Diarrhoea and enteritis disturb the normal functioning of the intestine. So the intestine cannot absorb the food properly. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 37 )
<s> However, sugar, salt and water in ORS can be absorbed by the linings of the intestine.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 38 )
<s> This simple cure has saved the lives of millions of children all over the world. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 39 )
<s> However, ORS only gives temporary relief, and it is important to take medical help as diarrhoea and enteritis can be life-threatening, especially in ill or malnourished individuals and small children. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 40 )
<s> Further treatment of diarrhoea and enteritis includes administration of antibiotics to kill the infectious agents. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 41 )
<s> Considering the numerous ill-effects of diarrhoea and enteritis, it is advisable to take preventive measures to avoid them. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 42 )
<s> To begin with, since consuming contaminated food and water are the main causes of diarrhoea and enteritis, both these diseases can be prevented by maintaining proper sanitation and hygiene. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 43 )
<s> It is very important to maintain personal cleanliness. You should always wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet and before eating food. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 44 )
<s> Further, you should always consume only clean food and water.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 45 )
<s> For instance, you should not drink water from outdoor wells, unclean vessels or other water sources without boiling or filtering it. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 46 )
<s> Likewise, you should eat food that has been cooked properly in a clean cooking area.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 47 )
<s> Moreover, fruits and vegetables should be washed thoroughly with lukewarm water before being eaten or cooked.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 48 )
<s> The food  should always be covered, so that flies and dust do not settle on it. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 49 )
<s> As the food sold by  road-side vendors is not covered, it is advisable to avoid eating such foods. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 50 )
<s> Food waste, domestic garbage and excretory wastes of pets or children should be immediately and appropriately disposed off. </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 51 )
<s> Thus, it can be seen that diarrhoea and enteritis transmitted through contaminated food and water can be prevented by eating clean food , maintaining personal hygiene and keeping the surroundings clean.  </s> (train MP_8_Biology_Common Diseases_Enteritis and Diarrhoea 52 )
<s> Have you observed that only some individuals are affected by fever or common cold during change in the seasons? </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 3 )
<s> Have you wondered why only some individuals are affected? Why not others? </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 4 )
<s> Generally, when our body is exposed to disease-causing microbes, it exhibits a defence mechanism. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 5 )
<s> This defence offered by the immune system in the body is called natural protection or active immunity. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 6 )
<s> If the resistance offered by the immune system is greater than the strength of the microbes, individuals are not affected by the disease. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 7 )
<s> However, those individuals with less resistance are affected by the disease-causing microbes. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 8 )
<s> Invariably, in all the individuals, active immunity can be stimulated by some external protection methods. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 9 )
<s> One such external protection method is vaccination. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 10 )
<s> Vaccination is the administration of a killed or weakened harmless variant of a disease-causing microbe into the body of an individual, in order to stimulate an immune response against pathogenic microbes.  </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 11 )
<s> This immune response activates lymphocytes and generates antibodies to kill the pathogens and clear them from the body. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 12 )
<s> Apart from antibodies, it also produces memory lymphocytic cells in the body, namely B-lymphocytes which are retained in the body. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 13 )
<s> So, if the vaccinated individual is attacked by a similar pathogen, these B memory cells have the property of recognising the pathogens and killing them.  </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 14 )
<s> Thus, the vaccinated person does not contract the disease as active immunity provided by vaccination lasts for many years in an individual's life time </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 15 )
<s> This was experimentally proven by Dr. Edward Jenner in 1796. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 16 )

<s> Cowpox was a disease resembling smallpox but with less intensity of symptoms. It was contracted from the cows. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 19 )
<s> Keeping this in mind, Dr. Jenner collected a pus-like material from a blister on the hand of a milk-maid caused by cowpox and injected it into an eight-year-old boy named James Phipps. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 20 )
<s> After six weeks, Phipps was inoculated with the smallpox virus by Dr. Jenner.  </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 21 )
<s> To his surprise, Phipps was not affected by the smallpox virus and he did not contract smallpox. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 22 )
<s> Dr. Jenner confirmed that the cowpox virus stimulated the immune system in Phipps’s body and produced antibodies and memory cells to clear the cowpox virus from the body. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 23 )
<s> When the smallpox virus entered the body, the retained memory cells produced antibodies and cleared the viruses from the body. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 24 )
<s> Dr. Jenner concluded that the cowpox material can be injected as a vaccine into the body of healthy people, so that they would not contract smallpox. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 25 )
<s> He thus coined the term vaccine which  comes from the Latin word “vacca” meaning ‘’cow” and “vaccinia” meaning “cowpox”. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 26 )
<s> The process of vaccination is otherwise called prophylaxis and the substance that is used for vaccination is called vaccine.  </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 27 )
<s> Vaccine when administered  to an individual triggers the production of antibodies and lymphocytes in the body to kill the pathogens, a phenomenon called immunisation. </s> (train MP_8_Common Diseases_Vaccination 28 )
